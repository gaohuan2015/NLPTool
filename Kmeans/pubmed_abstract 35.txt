Pathologic myopia is a leading cause of visual impairment. Development of myopic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is one of the most common complications thatleads to central vision loss in patients with pathologic myopia. If leftuntreated, it can cause scarring with expanding macular atrophy leading toirreversible visual loss in a period as short as 5 years. Advancements inmultimodal imaging technology have furthered our understanding of the condition; however, further studies are necessary to extend its utility in the diagnosis of myopic CNV. Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF)therapy has become the standard-of-care and the recommended first-line treatment option for myopic CNV. Long-term studies have demonstrated that early treatmentof confirmed myopic CNV cases with an intravitreal anti-VEGF agent is useful toavoid late-stage complications. This strategy has also been shown to achievevisual outcome improvements for up to 4 years and visual stabilization up to 6years. This review article provides an overview of the current knowledge onmyopic CNV and discusses recent updates in the diagnosis and management of thecondition. Furthermore, treatment recommendations are provided based on theauthors' expert opinions.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

It is a significant cause of visual lossin those with pathologic myopia. The current standard of care involves therapywith intravitreal inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).AREAS COVERED: The epidemiology of myopia, high myopia, pathologic myopia, andmyopic CNV is reviewed, along with a brief discussion of historical treatments.The pharmacology of the three most commonly used anti-VEGF agents is discussed,with an emphasis on the licensed drugs, ranibizumab and aflibercept. Acomprehensive clinical approach to diagnosis and treatment of myopic CNV ispresented.EXPERT OPINION: The current standard of care for myopic CNV is intravitrealinhibition of VEGF, with ranibizumab and aflibercept licensed for intraocularuse. The diagnosis, OCT features of disease activity and retreatment algorithmfor myopic CNV is different from wet age-related macular degeneration. In thelong-term, myopic CNV may be associated with gradual, irreversible visual lossdue to progressive chorioretinal atrophy, for which there is currently notreatment.DOI: 10.1517/14712598.2016.1167868 PMID: 26985834  [Indexed for MEDLINE]

It is also one of the mostfrequently encountered non.age-related macular degeneration causes of CNV andaffects young patients in the working age group. Fluorescein angiography (FA) andspectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) are generally indicated toconfirm the diagnosis of active myopic CNV before initiation of treatment.Without treatment, natural history studies have shown that the vision outcome canbe very poor. More recently, a number of retrospective, prospective and phase 3, multicenter, randomized controlled trials have established the safety andefficacy of intravitreal anti.vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agentsfor the treatment of myopic CNV. Long-term follow-up studies have found that someof the initial vision gained after intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy may not bemaintained, owing to the presence and progression of chorioretinal atrophy (CRA) adjacent to the CNV. Further research on clinical and imaging characteristics mayelucidate the prognostic factors that are crucial to optimizing the treatment andprevention of visual impairment associated with myopic CNV.Copyright 2017 Asia-Pacific Academy of Ophthalmology.DOI: 10.22608/APO.2017308 PMID: 29057641  [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Collected data included demographic details, clinical examination details including visualacuity at presentation and follow-up with imaging and treatment details. Mainoutcome measures were resolution of CNV activity at the last visit. Secondaryoutcomes included change in visual acuity, number of injections and adverseevents.RESULTS: Thirty-three eyes of 31 subjects with a mean age of 51.48±16.4 yearswere included. The mean follow-up was 66.47 months. 27 eyes had type 2 CNV andthe rest seven eyes had type 1 CNV. The mean number of IVB injections per eye was4.9. Mean visual acuity at baseline reduced from 0.65±0.33 logMAR units (Snellen equivalent=20/89) to 0.73±0.50 logMAR units (20/107) at final follow-up(p=0.003). The mean central macular thickness decreased from 309.31±86 µm atbaseline to 267.5±70.89 µm at the last visit (p=0.03). However, visual acuity wasmaintained (±1 line of baseline) in 13 eyes (39.4%), ≥2 line improvement in nine (27.3%) eyes and more than two lines worsening in 11 eyes (33.3%). Foveal atrophywas observed at baseline and last visit in 6 (12.5%) and 14 (29.1%), respectively(p=0.007). No systemic adverse events were observed.CONCLUSION: IVB monotherapy is safe and effective for long-term treatment of CNV secondary to myopia in real life.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

Theprevalence of myopic CNV was monitored during this period, and the frequency and cost of both treatment visits and monitoring visits were analyzed for 2 yearsfollowing diagnosis.RESULTS: The prevalence of myopic CNV was 0.017%. In total, 9068 patients withmyopic CNV were identified, 12.3% (n = 1111) of whom were treated. Of thosetreated, 72.0% (n = 800) received intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growthfactor injections (IVI); the remainder received either photodynamic therapy with verteporfin (vPDT), laser photocoagulation, or a combination of therapies. IVIwas associated with the largest number of treatment visits as well as a higheradministrative (non-drug) cost per treatment visit (a mean of USD 57.18). vPDTalone was associated with a higher overall cost per treatment visit and moremonitoring visits than IVI or laser photocoagulation. Costs for monitoring visitswere highest for IVI.CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of myopic CNV was lower than that reported inprevious studies, possibly because of differences in age distribution in thepopulations studied. The frequencies of treatment administered were similar tothose reported in previous studies; however, a cost-effectiveness comparisoncould not be made owing to lack of data in previous studies.DOI: 10.1007/s10384-016-0496-3 PMID: 28062929  [Indexed for MEDLINE]

It is a sight-threateningcomplication of pathologic myopia (PM) and often affects patients in theirworking years causing significant impact on quality of life. Previous therapiessuch as photodynamic therapy with verteporfin have shown limited success. Due to the similarities in pathogenesis of mCNV and AMD CNV, anti-vascular endothelialgrowth factor therapy (anti-VEGF), which has so far been the mainstay oftreatment for AMD CNV, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of mCNVand has become the first-line treatment of choice. This article aims to examinebriefly the epidemiology and pathophysiology of mCNV, as well as review theevidence for efficacy, safety, and clinical use of anti-VEGF treatment for mCNV.DOI: 10.1007/s40265-016-0605-0 PMID: 27364753  [Indexed for MEDLINE]

The cumulative occurrence of CRA progression wasassessed using a Kaplan-Meier analysis. Demographic and clinical characteristics including macular choroidal thickness in various areas were compared betweenpatients with and without CRA progression.RESULTS: The mean age was 52.34 years. A mean of 4.84 anti-vascular endothelialgrowth factor injections were performed over the mean follow-up duration of 44.6 months. Eventually, 15 eyes (30%) developed CRA progression. The estimatedoccurrence of CRA progression was 10% at 1 year, 19.1% at 2 years, 23.6% at 3 and4 years, and 35.4% at 5 years. Chorioretinal atrophy progression was associatedwith a subfoveal CNV location (P = 0.029) and thinner subfoveal choroid inrelation to the inferior choroid at 3 mm (P = 0.008). Visual improvement was onlysignificant in eyes without CRA progression at 1 year, 2 years, and at the final visit.CONCLUSION: Chorioretinal atrophy progression was associated with a poorlong-term prognosis. Relative thinning of the subfoveal choroid about theinferior choroid and subfoveal CNV location may predispose eyes with myopic CNVto develop CRA progression after anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy.DOI: 10.1097/IAE.0000000000001384 PMID: 27798519  [Indexed for MEDLINE]

When divided into 3 groups according to CNV duration before treatment (<2, 2-8, and 8-24 weeks), the recurrence rate (19, 25, and 52%,respectively; p = 0.006) and number of injections (3.5, 4.0, and 5.5,respectively; p = 0.021) were significantly lower in eyes with a shorter durationof CNV.CONCLUSIONS: Early anti-VEGF treatment of myopic CNV decreased the recurrencerate and number of injections and improved visual outcome.© 2017 S.

The associations between the distribution of the rs2010963genotype and the number of eyes with maintained or improved visual acuity (VA)were analyzed. Furthermore, multivariable logistic regression analysis wasperformed to adjust for 7 possible prognostic factors, including age, sex, CNVsize, CNV location, administration of loading dose, pretreatment VA, and numberof additional treatments.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point was maintenance of VA, and secondaryend points were progression of chorioretinal atrophy (CRA) and recurrence of CNV.RESULTS: Mean age and mean axial length were not significantly different among 3 genotypes of rs2010963. The percentage of eyes with maintained or improved VA wassignificantly higher with the G allele of rs2010963 (P =0.016), and stepwiseanalysis revealed that both rs2010963 and CNV size were associated with VAmaintenance (P =0.040 and 0.033, respectively). The secondary analysis revealedthat administration of a loading dose was significantly associated with both CRA progression (P =0.031) and recurrence of CNV (P =0.020), whereas rs2010963 wasnot.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the VEGF polymorphism influences the VAprognosis in highly myopic eyes with CNV within 1 year after anti-VEGF treatment.This association was still observed after removing its confounding effect throughCNV size. The rs2010963 polymorphism was not associated with CNV recurrence orCRA progression, which indicates that these changes are not tied to intrinsicfactors and may be controllable by improving treatment methods.Copyright © 2014 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

Once developed, most eyes with myopic CNV (mCNV) experience a progression to macular atrophy, which leads to irreversible vision loss.Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy is used to treatdiseases characterised by neovascularisation and is increasingly used to treatmCNV.OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor(anti-VEGF) therapy for choroidal neovascularisation (CNV), compared with othertreatments, sham treatment or no treatment, in people with pathological myopia.SEARCH METHODS: We searched a number of electronic databases including CENTRALand Ovid MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO)International Clinical Trials Registry Platform ICTRP). We did not use any dateor language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. Electronicdatabases were last searched on 16 June 2016.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) andquasi-RCTs comparing anti-VEGF therapy with another treatment (e.g. photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin, laser photocoagulation, macular surgery, another anti-VEGF), sham treatment or no treatment in participants with mCNV.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expectedby Cochrane. Two authors independently screened records, extracted data, andassessed risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional data. Weanalysed outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences (MDs). We graded thecertainty of the evidence using GRADE.MAIN RESULTS: The present review included six studies which provided data on the comparison between anti-VEGF with PDT, laser, sham treatment and anotheranti-VEGF treatment, with 594 participants with mCNV. Three trials comparedbevacizumab or ranibizumab with PDT, one trial compared bevacizumab with laser,one trial compared aflibercept with sham treatment, and two trials comparedbevacizumab with ranibizumab. Pharmaceutical companies conducted two trials. The trials were conducted at multiple clinical centres across three continents(Europe, Asia and North America). In all these six trials, one eye for eachparticipant was included in the study.When compared with PDT, people treated withanti-VEGF agents (ranibizumab (one RCT), bevacizumab (two RCTs)), were morelikely to regain vision. At one year of follow-up, the mean visual acuity (VA) inparticipants treated with anti-VEGFs was -0.14 logMAR better, equivalent of sevenEarly Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters, compared with people treated with PDT (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.20 to -0.08, 3 RCTs, 263people, low-certainty evidence). The RR for proportion of participants gaining 3+lines of VA was 1.86 (95% CI 1.27 to 2.73, 2 RCTs, 226 people, moderate-certaintyevidence). At two years, the mean VA in people treated with anti-VEGFs was -0.26 logMAR better, equivalent of 13 ETDRS letters, compared with people treated with PDT (95% CI -0.38 to -0.14, 2 RCTs, 92 people, low-certainty evidence). The RRfor proportion of people gaining 3+ lines of VA at two years was 3.43 (95% CI1.37 to 8.56, 2 RCTs, 92 people, low-certainty evidence). People treated withanti-VEGFs showed no obvious reduction (improvement) in central retinal thicknessat one year compared with people treated with PDT (MD -17.84 μm, 95% CI -41.98 to6.30, 2 RCTs, 226 people, moderate-certainty evidence). There was low-certaintyevidence that people treated with anti-VEGF were more likely to have CNVangiographic closure at 1 year (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.54, 2 RCTs, 208people). One study allowed ranibizumab treatment as of month 3 in participantsrandomised to PDT, which may have led to an underestimate of the benefits ofanti-VEGF treatment.When compared with laser photocoagulation, there was moreimprovement in VA among bevacizumab-treated people than among laser-treatedpeople after one year (MD -0.22 logMAR, equivalent of 11 ETDRS letters, 95% CI-0.43 to -0.01, 1 RCT, 36 people, low-certainty evidence) and after two years (MD-0.29 logMAR, equivalent of 14 ETDRS letters, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.08, 1 RCT, 36people, low-certainty evidence).When compared with sham treatment, people treatedwith aflibercept had better vision at one year (MD -0.19 logMAR, equivalent of 9 ETDRS letters, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.12, 1 RCT, 121 people, moderate-certaintyevidence). The fact that this study allowed for aflibercept treatment at 6 monthsin the control group might cause an underestimation of the benefit withanti-VEGF.People treated with ranibizumab had similar improvement in VA recovery compared with people treated with bevacizumab after one year (MD -0.02 logMAR,equivalent of 1 ETDRS letter, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.06, 2 RCTs, 80 people,moderate-certainty evidence).Of the included six studies, two studies reported noadverse events in either group and two industry-sponsored studies reported bothsystemic and ocular adverse events. In the control group, there were no systemic or ocular adverse events reported in 149 participants. Fifteen people reportedsystemic serious adverse events among 359 people treated with anti-VEGF agents(15/359, 4.2%). Five people reported ocular adverse events among 359 peopletreated with anti-VEGF agents (5/359, 1.4%). The number of adverse events waslow, and the estimate of RR was uncertain regarding systemic serious adverseevents (4 RCTs, 15 events in 508 people, RR 4.50, 95% CI 0.60 to 33.99, verylow-certainty evidence) and serious ocular adverse events (4 RCTs, 5 events in508 people, RR 1.82, 95% CI 0.23 to 14.71, very low-certainty evidence). Therewere no reports of mortality or cases of endophthalmitis or retinaldetachment.There was sparse reporting of data for vision-related quality of life (in favour of anti-VEGF) in only one trial at one year of follow-up. The studies did not report data for other outcomes, such as percentage of participants withnewly developed chorioretinal atrophy.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is low to moderate-certainty evidence from RCTs forthe efficacy of anti-VEGF agents to treat mCNV at one year and two years.Moderate-certainty evidence suggests ranibizumab and bevacizumab are equivalentin terms of efficacy. Adverse effects occurred rarely and the trials includedhere were underpowered to assess these. Future research should be focused on the efficacy and safety of different drugs and treatment regimens, the efficacy ondifferent location of mCNV, as well as the effects on practice in the real world.DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011160.pub2 PMID: 27977064  [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Baselinechoroidal thickness was measured at the fovea and 1.5 and 3 mm nasal, temporal,superior, and inferior to the fovea using enhanced depth imaging opticalcoherence tomography. Measurements were compared between eyes with and withoutCNV resolution after a single injection and between those with and without CNVrecurrence within 1 year of initial injection. Associations between treatmentoutcomes and morphologic or clinical factors were assessed using regressionanalyses.RESULTS: Patients received 1.8 ± 1.3 intravitreal injections during follow-up.Eyes with CNV resolution after a single anti-VEGF injection had a significantlythicker inferior choroid than those without resolution (67.3 ± 32.9 vs. 44.5 ±17.6 μm, P = 0.002). The subfoveal choroid was thinner in eyes with recurring CNVthan in those without recurrence (35.7 ± 23.7 vs. 52.0 ± 20.8 μm, P = 0.029).Associations were found between inferior choroidal thickness and CNV resolution(P = 0.019) and between subfoveal choroidal thickness and 1-year recurrence rates(P = 0.016). Adjusted odds ratios were 9.1 for CNV resolution with an inferiorchoroidal thickness >49 μm and 5.6 for recurrence within 1 year with a subfoveal choroidal thickness ≤47.5 μm.CONCLUSIONS: A thinner subfoveal/inferior choroid at baseline may indicate pooranatomic outcome after intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment in eyes with myopic CNV.DOI: 10.1167/iovs.12-11542 PMID: 23462751  [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Covariates of interest were demographiccharacteristics, laboratory values, and clinical factors such as previousanti-vascular endothelial growth factor used, number of involved eyes, year oftreatment, and time since last injection. Those variables that changed with time were assessed and updated at each visit. The main outcome measure was the odds ofreceiving treatment at any visit.RESULTS:: In total, 189 new diabetic macular edema patients with follow-up wereanalyzed, covering 729 visits with 543 (74.5%) receiving treatment. Univariateanalysis showed that male gender (odds ratio: 0.54, 95% confidence interval:0.32-0.91, p = 0.03), every week since last injection (odds ratio: 0.94, 95%confidence interval: 0.91-0.97, p = 0.001), and having two eyes affected (oddsratio: 2.09, 95% confidence interval: 1.10-3.97, p = 0.02) were associated withgetting an injection. After multivariate analysis, only time since previousinjection with every week that passed reduced the odds on having an injection at the next visit (odds ratio: 0.95, 95% confidence interval: 0.92-0.97, p < 0.001).Anemia was not associated with receiving an injection (odds ratio: 1.05, 95%confidence interval: 0.61-1.80, p = 0.86).CONCLUSION:: This study used time-varying methodology to better identify whichpatients will likely need an injection at any one visit. While anemia was notfound to impact injections, our results can aid future endeavors that mayincorporate clinical visit information in developing a full prediction model tohelp make diabetic macular edema care more efficient.DOI: 10.1177/1120672119827856 PMID: 30764665

However, the treatmentefficacies of IVR monotherapy in real-world clinical settings are not wellknown.The medical records of 56 eyes from 38 patients who received their firstIVR for DME between April 2014 and March 2015, and were retreated with IVRmonotherapy as needed with no rescue treatment, such as laser photocoagulation,were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical course, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and fundus findings at baseline, before the initial IVR injection, and at12 months, were evaluated.Twenty-five eyes from 25 patients (16 men; mean age68.7 ± 9.8 years) who received IVR in the first eye, or unilaterally, without anyother treatments during follow-up were included. After 12 months, mean centralretinal thickness (CRT), which includes edema, was reduced (P = .003), althoughmean BCVA remained unchanged. There was a negative correlation between individualchanges in BCVA (r = -0.57; P = .003) and CRT (r = -0.60; P = .002) at 12 months compared with baseline values. BCVA changes were greater in individuals with ahistory of pan-retinal photocoagulation at baseline (P = .026). After adjustingfor age and sex, CRT improvement >100 μm at 12 months was associated with agreater CRT at baseline (OR 0.87 per 10 μm [95% CI 0.72-0.97]; P = .018)according to logistic regression analyses; however, better BCVA and CRT at 12months were associated with a better BCVA (r = 0.77; P < .001) and lower CRT(r = 0.41; P = .039) at baseline, respectively, according to linear regressionanalyses.IVR monotherapy suppressed DME, and the effects varied according tobaseline conditions. Eyes that had poorer BCVA or greater CRT, or a history ofpan-retinal photocoagulation at baseline, demonstrated greater improvement withIVR monotherapy. In contrast, to achieve better outcome values, DME eyes shouldbe treated before the BCVA and CRT deteriorate. These findings advance ourunderstanding of the optimal use of IVR for DME in daily clinical practice,although further study is warranted.DOI: 10.1097/MD.0000000000006459 PMCID: PMC5406051PMID: 28422835  [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Baseline best-corrected visual acuity(BCVA) was between 0.3 and 1.0 on a logarithm of minimum angle of resolutionvisual chart.METHODS: The OCT scans previous to DEX implants were evaluated for submacularfluid, size and location of cystoid changes, inner segment-outer segment (IS-OS) continuity, quantity and location of hyperreflective foci (HRF), vitreomacularinterface abnormalities, and epiretinal membrane. The BCVA and central macularthickness were recorded at baseline and at 1, 2, and 4 months after treatmentwith DEX implants. Correlations between OCT measures and visual outcome wereanalyzed using the generalized estimating equations procedure.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The correlation between spectral-domain (SD) OCT measures at baseline and BCVA response (mean change from baseline; categorized improvement[<5, 5-9, or ≥10; Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters] in BCVA)after treatment with a DEX implant.RESULTS: The presence of subretinal fluid (odds ratio [OR], 1.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-3.20; P = 0.01), absence of HRF (OR, 3.66; 95% CI, 1.40-9.62;P = 0.01), and integrity of the IS-OS layer (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.30-3.37; P =0.003) were all predictive of better visual outcome after treatment with DEXimplants. Although eyes with naïve DME gained more vision than refractory eyes (P< 0.001), the predictive value of OCT findings did not differ according to thisclassification.CONCLUSIONS: Spectral-domain OCT is useful in identifying various imagingfindings in DME. Among eyes with DME, those with submacular fluid, no HRF, and a continuous IS-OS layer responded better to DEX implants than those without these features. These findings call for further study of combinations of OCTand metabolic biomarkers.Copyright © 2017 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

Fox chair in Ophthalmology, Tel Aviv University, TelAviv, Israel.PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate biomarkers and predictive factors for visual andanatomical outcome in patients with naïve diabetic macular edema (DME) whounderwent small gauge pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with internal limiting membrane(ILM) peeling as a first line treatment.DESIGN: Multicenter, retrospective, interventional study.PARTICIPANTS: 120 eyes from 120 patients with naïve DME treated with PPV and ILM peeling with a follow up of 24 months.METHODS: Change in baseline best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and centralsubfoveal thickness (CST) 1, 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery. Predictive value of baseline BCVA, CST, optical coherence tomography (OCT) features (presence ofsubretinal fluid (SRF) and photoreceptor damage), and time between DME diagnosis and surgery. Additional treatment for DME needed. Intra- and post-operativecomplications (cataract rate formation, increased intraocular pressure).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The correlation between baseline characteristics and BCVA response (mean change from baseline; categorized improvement ≥5 or ≥10; EarlyTreatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters) 12 and 24 months aftersurgery.RESULTS: Mean BCVA was 0.66 ± 0.14 logMAR, 0.52 ± 0.21 logMAR, and 0.53 ± 0.21logMAR (p<0.001) at baseline, 12 and 24 months, respectively. Shorter time fromDME diagnosis until PPV (OR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.97-0.99, p<0.001) was a predictorfor good functional treatment response (area under the curve 0.828). For everyday PPV is postponed, the patient's chances to gain ≥5 letters at 24 monthsdecrease by 1.8%. Presence of SRF was identified as an anatomical predictor of a better visual outcome, (OR: 6.29, 95% CI: 1.16-34.08, p = 0.033). Safety profile was acceptable.CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal a significant functional and anatomicalimprovement of DME 24 months after primary PPV, without the need for additionaltreatment. Early surgical intervention and presence of SRF predict good visualoutcome. These biomarkers should be considered when treatment is chosen.DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0200365 PMCID: PMC6040739PMID: 29995929  [Indexed for MEDLINE]Conflict of interest statement: The authors have declared that no competinginterests exist.

A threshold of a calculated MA formation rate of 2or more was chosen to consider a patient "positive." The ability to predict CSME development was then calculated for a period of up to 5 years. HbA1c values,blood pressure, or duration of diabetes were also evaluated.RESULTS: The study population consisted of 89 male and 59 female patients with a mean age of 57.6 years, a mean HbA1c of 7.8, and a mean duration of diabetes of12.3 years. Forty-seven of 287 eyes (16.4%) developed CSME during follow-up. Anincreased MA formation rate of >2 MA was clearly associated with development ofCSME. Using the automated analysis and a threshold of 2 or more new MA, theauthors were able to identify 70.2% of the eyes that developed CSME duringfollow-up ("true positive") and using a threshold of up to 2 new MA, 71.7% of thepatients that did not develop CSME ("true negative"). No significant differences concerning baseline and 1-year HbA1c levels within patient eyes that developedCSME compared with patient eyes below or over the calculated threshold of 2 MA (P= 0.554 and P = 0.890, respectively) were seen. The positive and negativepredictive value was calculated to be 33% versus 92.5%, sensitivity was 70%, and specificity was 72%.CONCLUSION: Using the RetmarkerDR software, the authors were able to identifypatients with higher risk to develop CSME during follow-up using a threshold of 2or more MA formation rate. Together with the high negative predictive value, the automated analysis may help to determine the individual risk of a patient todevelop sight-threatening complications related to diabetic retinopathy andschedule individual screening intervals.DOI: 10.1097/IAE.0b013e318295f6de PMID: 23792485  [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Experimental andclinical evidence has demonstrated that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)plays a vital role in the formation of choroidal neovascularization. Intravitrealinjections of anti-VEGF agents have been recommended as a first-line treatmentfor neovascular AMD. However, persistent fluid or recurrent exudation stilloccurs despite standardized anti-VEGF therapy. Patients suffering from refractoryor recurrent neovascular AMD may develop mechanisms of resistance to anti-VEGFtherapy, which results in a diminished therapeutic effect. Until now, there hasbeen no consensus on the definitions of refractory neovascular AMD and recurrent neovascular AMD. This article aims at clarifying these concepts to evaluate theefficacy of switching drugs, which contributes to making clinical decision morescientifically. Furthermore, insight into the causes of resistance to anti-VEGFtherapy would be helpful for developing possible therapeutic approaches, such as combination therapy and multi-target treatment that can overcome this resistance.DOI: 10.2147/DDDT.S97653 PMCID: PMC4898027PMID: 27330279  [Indexed for MEDLINE]

This studyinvestigated the relationship between the need for anti-VEGF retreatment inpatients with nAMD and antidepressant medication, and the potential impact ofocular structural factors.METHODS: Data from two identical prospective 2-year treatment protocols usingranibizumab or aflibercept in a variable-dosing regimen ('Observe-and-Plan') wereanalysed. Retreatment requirement was compared with antidepressant medicationintake (primary outcome) and a variety of ocular factors from baseline and frommonth 3 response (secondary outcomes), using univariate and multivariateanalyses.RESULTS: Of the 206 included patients (227 eyes), 19 were on antidepressantmedication. Their nAMD eyes significantly more often had pigment epitheliumdetachment (PED, p=0.04). Multivariate analysis revealed a significantassociation between anti-VEGF retreatment requirement and antidepressantmedication use (p=0.027), as well as thicker central retinal thickness at month 3(p<0.0001) and month 3 PED height (p=0.001).CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that treatment with antidepressantmedication increases the anti-VEGF retreatment requirement in patients with nAMD,possibly through the interplay of antidepressant medication, depression statusand VEGF levels.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

Our further aim was to examine the changes in thefrequency of injections of ranibizumab before and after ORT appearance.METHODS: Two hundred thirty six eyes of 230 patients were included in the study(184 eyes treated with ranibizumab by pro re nata regimen (PRN), 52 eyes withaflibercept bimonthly) and followed for 6-24 months. Using optical coherencetomography (OCT), the first appearance of ORT was documented, and fixed timepoint evaluations were also made every six months to determine the existence ofORT. The number of injections, the presence or absence of subretinalhyperreflective material (SHRM) at treatment initiation and visual acuity werealso noted.RESULTS: The survival analysis with Cox proportional hazard model showed nosignificant difference between the ranibizumab and aflibercept groups in relationto the development of ORT (p = 0.79, hazard ratio 0.92). In the PRN treatedranibizumab group the number of injections showed significant decrease after ORT development (p = 0.004). When SHRM was present at treatment initiation the chanceof developing ORT was 2.75 and 11.14 times higher in the ranibizumab andaflibercept groups, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of ORT increased over time independently from thechosen anti-VEGF drug. Our results suggest that upon the appearance of ORT adecrease in retreatments can be expected.DOI: 10.1186/s12886-018-0960-6 PMCID: PMC6236952PMID: 30428856  [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Electronic address: nholekamp@gmail.com.(2)Allergan, Inc., Irvine, California.(3)Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.(4)Carolina Eye Associates, Southern Pines, North Carolina.PURPOSE: To examine bevacizumab and ranibizumab utilization and diseasemonitoring patterns in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration(neovascular AMD) in clinical practice.DESIGN: Retrospective medical claims analysis.METHODS: Patients receiving ≥1 ranibizumab or bevacizumab injection during the 12months after initial neovascular AMD diagnosis were included. Annual bevacizumab and/or ranibizumab injection utilization was assessed by year of first injection cohorts: 2006 and 2007 (received either agent because of billing code overlap),2008, 2009, and January-June 2010 (received each agent). Outcome measures weretime to first injection relative to neovascular AMD diagnosis and mean numbers ofintravitreal injections, ophthalmologist visits, and optical coherence tomography(OCT) and fluorescein angiography (FA) examinations in 12 months.RESULTS: In the 2006 and 2007 cohorts (n = 8767), mean annual numbers ofbevacizumab or ranibizumab injections were 4.7 and 5.0, respectively. Over 92% ofpatients in all cohorts received first treatment within 3 months of neovascularAMD diagnosis. In the 2008-2010 cohorts (n = 10 259), mean annual number ofinjections remained low (bevacizumab: 4.6, 5.1, and 5.5; ranibizumab: 6.1, 6.6,and 6.9), as did mean numbers of ophthalmologist visits (bevacizumab only) andOCT examinations (both agents), but there was no such trend in FA examinations.CONCLUSIONS: Compared with treatment paradigms validated by clinical trialspublished at the time, in clinical practice, patients with neovascular AMDreceived fewer bevacizumab or ranibizumab injections and less-frequent monitoringfrom 2006 to mid-2011. Factors contributing to this lower injection frequency andvisual outcomes associated with reduced utilization need to be researched.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The primary outcome was change in best-corrected visualacuity (BCVA) score after 12 months.RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 12 months, and the median number of afliberceptinjections was 2.0 (range 1-4). Overall, mean BCVA improved from 0.59 ± 0.37logMAR at baseline to 0.38 ± 0.33 logMAR at 12 months, a change of -0.21 ± 0.23logMAR (p < 0.0001), and from 70.5 ± 18.5 to 81.1 ± 16.4 letters, a change of10.6 ± 11.4 (p < 0.0001). Improvements were similar among patients irrespectiveof previous PDT. The Increase in BCVA was greater in younger patients (aged <50 years) and those with baseline BCVA of ≤ 75 letters.CONCLUSION: Intravitreal aflibercept in a PRN regimen is effective for thetreatment of myopic CNV, with no apparent short-term safety effects. Treated eyeshad BCVA gains after 12 months, with a median of two injections.DOI: 10.1007/s00417-016-3396-9 PMID: 27286893  [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Ophthalmology. 2016 Feb;123(2):e16-7.PURPOSE: To evaluate intravitreal aflibercept 2 mg in patients with myopicchoroidal neovascularization (CNV).DESIGN: An international, phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-masked,sham-controlled study.PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged ≥ 18 years with high myopia (≤-6.0 diopters or axial length of ≥ 26.5 mm), active myopic CNV, and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 73-35 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters in the study eye wereincluded.METHODS: Patients were randomized 3:1 to intravitreal aflibercept or sham. In theintravitreal aflibercept arm, patients received 1 injection at baseline.Additional injections were performed in case of CNV persistence or recurrence at monthly visits through week 44. In the sham arm, patients received shaminjections through week 20. At week 24, after assessment of the primary efficacy end point, sham patients received a mandatory intravitreal aflibercept injection followed by intravitreal aflibercept (if disease persisted/recurred) or shaminjection every 4 weeks.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean change in BCVA from baseline to week 24.RESULTS: A total of 122 patients were randomized to intravitreal aflibercept (n =91) or sham (n = 31). Baseline demographics were similar across groups. At week24, patients in the intravitreal aflibercept and sham groups gained 12.1 and lost2 letters, respectively (P < 0.0001). By week 48, patients in the intravitrealaflibercept and sham/intravitreal aflibercept groups gained 13.5 and 3.9 letters.Patients in the intravitreal aflibercept group received 2 injections (median) in the first study quarter (week 0-8). Median number of injections in quarters 2 to 4 was 0. Patients in the "sham/intravitreal aflibercept" group received 2 and 1(median) intravitreal aflibercept injections in quarters 3 and 4. Central retinalthickness improved in parallel with visual gains. Incidence of ocular adverseevents was similar in both groups through week 48 (37.4% vs. 38.7); most wereassessed by investigators as mild. No deaths occurred.CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal aflibercept 2 mg was effective for treatment of myopic CNV with clinically important visual and anatomic benefits achieved with alimited number of injections given in the first 8 weeks of treatment. No newsafety concerns occurred with treatment. Intravitreal aflibercept should beconsidered as a treatment option for myopic CNV.Copyright © 2015 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

Rodolico Vittorio Emanuele Hospital, Catania, Italy.AIM The aim of this study is to evaluate long-term efficacy of intravitrealinjections of aflibercept as primary treatment for subfoveal/juxtafoveal myopicchoroidal neovascularisation (CNV).METHODS Thirty-eight treatment-naive eyes ofthirty-eight patients with subfoveal/juxtafoveal myopic CNV received initialintravitreal aflibercept injections and were followed for at least 18 months.Aflibercept was applied again for persistent or recurrent CNV, as required.Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS.RESULTS Mean patient age was 45.8years, and mean eye refractive error was -7.79 D. For the total patient group(n=38 eyes), mean logMAR best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) significantlyimproved from 0.69 at baseline to 0.15 at 18 months (P<0.01). Over half of thetreated eyes obtained resolution with one aflibercept injection. Patients werealso grouped according to age, as <50 years (n=20 eyes) and ≥50 years (n=18eyes). Mean BCVA improvement was significantly greater in eyes of the youngermyopic CNV group, compared with those of ≥50 years (0.21 vs 0.35; P<0.05). Themean number of aflibercept injections was 1.8 for the <50 years myopic CNV group,and 3.6 for the ≥50 years myopic CNV group (P<0.001). Correlation betweenspherical equivalent refraction and final visual acuity reached statisticalsignificance only for the <50 years myopic CNV group (P<0.001; Levene'scorrelation).CONCLUSIONS Intravitreal aflibercept provides long-term visualacuity improvement in myopic CNV. The <50 years old myopic CNV group hadsignificantly fewer injections, with greater visual acuity improvement.Intravitreal aflibercept in myopic CNV does not require the three-injectionloading phase used for aflibercept treatment of neovascular age-related maculardegeneration.DOI: 10.1038/eye.2015.199 PMCID: PMC4709541PMID: 26514244  [Indexed for MEDLINE]

IVR or IVA was administered for up to 1 year. The best-correctedvisual acuity (BCVA) was measured, and fundus photographs and fundusautofluorescence were obtained before and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after theinitial treatment. The clinical characteristics including the macular choroidalthickness in various areas and CRA progression were compared between the drugs.The clinical characteristics and macular choroidal thicknesses were comparedbetween eyes with and without CRA progression.RESULTS: The BCVA improved significantly (p < 0.05 for all comparisons) from 0.44to 0.26, 0.19, 0.20, and 0.17 after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. CRAprogressed in 12 (40%) eyes over 1 year. The CRA progression did not differsignificantly between aflibercept and ranibizumab. The foveal choroid wassignificantly (p = 0.0043) thinner in aflibercept-treated eyes compared withranibizumab-treated eyes at 1 year. Subfoveal CNV tended to cause CRA progressionmore frequently at 1 year, although this did not reach significance.CONCLUSIONS: IVA to treat mCNV caused more severe thinning of the foveal choroid than ranibizumab; however, no significant difference was seen in CRA progression between the drugs and the choroidal thickness should not be associated with CRAprogression. The CNV location may predict CRA progression after anti-vascularendothelial growth factor therapy for mCNV.DOI: 10.1007/s00417-018-04214-w PMID: 30643966

The patients with treatment-naïve mCNVreceived 1 + PRN intravitreal bevacizumab from March 2008 to February 2013, whilefrom March 2013 to July 2016 patients were treated by 1 + PRN intravitrealaflibercept, all with monthly follow-up for 12 months. Primary outcome measuresincluded change in central foveal thickness (CFT) in 1 mm by spectral-domainoptic coherence tomography, and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at month 12. Complications after injections were recorded. The intra-group changes in CFT and BCVA were compared with Wilcoxon signed rank test, the between-group differencecompared with Wilcoxon rank sum test. Fisher's exact test was used forcategorical comparison between groups. Seventy-eight eyes of 78 patients werecollected. There were 42 eyes in bevacizumab group, with mean age of 53.2 ± 5.4years and 27 female patients of them. The mean BCVA significantly improved frombaseline 0.56 ± 0.35 logMAR to 0.35 ± 0.35 logMAR at Month 12 after bevacizumabtreatment (p < 0.001). The mean CFT significantly decreased from baseline315.3 ± 25.6 μm to 253.7 ± 24.4 μm at Month 12 following intravitreal bevacizumab(p < 0.001). There were 36 eyes in aflibercept group, with mean age of 52.8 ± 6.8years and 24 female patients of them. The mean BCVA significantly improved frombaseline 0.61 ± 0.47 logMAR to 0.38 ± 0.41 logMAR at Month 12 after aflibercepttreatment (p < 0.001). The mean CFT significantly decreased from baseline328.2 ± 19.8 μm to 241.8 ± 27.2 μm at Month 12 following intravitreal aflibercept(p < 0.001). The baseline demographics, lens status, axial length, refractiveerrors, duration of symptoms, BCVA, and CFT did not differ significantly between groups (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference between bevacizumab andaflibercept groups in BCVA and CFT from Month 1 to Month 12 (p > 0.05). Injectionnumber of aflibercept was 2.11 ± 0.41, less than that of bevacizumab(3.23 ± 0.38) during 12-month period (p = 0.01). There were no systemicthromboembolic event, elevated intraocular pressure, retinal detachment, orinfectious endophthalmitis following injections in both groups. We concluded thatboth aflibercept and bevacizumab can effectively treat choroidalneovascularization in high myopes. Intravitreal aflibercept had similar efficacy but less treatment number than bevacizumab for mCNV during 12-month period.DOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-32761-z PMCID: PMC6158246PMID: 30258077

New antiangiogenicdrugs are being used off-label with varied therapeutic schedules to treat CNV.The aim of this study is to report the anatomical and visual outcomes of myopicchoroidal neovascularization (CNV) treated by two different schedules withintravitreal bevacizumab.METHODS: Prospective, comparative, consecutive, non-randomized, multicentric,interventional pilot study. Two groups of highly myopic patients with subfovealand juxtafoveal CNV were treated by monthly intravitreal injections with 1.25 mg bevacizumab. Group 1 comprised 19 eyes treated by three consecutive monthlyintravitreal injections. Group 2 comprised 20 eyes treated by one singleintravitreal injection. Patients were evaluated for best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) at baseline and then monthly.Fluorescein angiography was performed at baseline and when CNV activity wassuspected. Further intravitreal injections were performed if CNV activity wasdetected.RESULTS: Both groups were matched for age, spherical equivalent, LogMAR BCVA, andcentral foveal thickness (CFT) as determined by OCT at baseline and number ofeyes with previous PDT treatment. The average number of letters gained was 6.3 ingroup 1 vs 7.2 in group 2 (p = 0.001 and 0.09 respectively, Student's t-test for paired data). Changes in OCT were not significant for either group by the end of follow-up. The mean number injections performed was 3.2 in group 1 vs 1.7 ingroup 2 (p = 0.00, Mann-Whitney test). Four recurrences (four eyes) occurred ingroup 1 vs 15 (seven eyes) in group 2 (p = 0.001; Fisher's exact test).CONCLUSIONS: Both schedules achieved similar results improving BCVA, though thesecond group required a lower number of injections, showing a higher rate ofrecurrences during the first year.DOI: 10.1007/s00417-010-1599-z PMID: 21234588  [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Three additional monthly injections were performed in eyes with persistent CNV leakage after 3 months. Patients werefollowed up for 6 months, and the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), changes influorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) results wereassessed.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in BCVA, angiographic closure, and OCT centralfoveal thickness (CFT) at the 6-month follow-up.RESULTS: The mean+/-standard deviation (SD) spherical equivalent refractive errorof the 22 eyes was -10.3+/-3.7 D (range, -6.0D to -18.0D). All patients completedfollow-up at 6 months. Twenty (90.9%) eyes had angiographic closure after 3monthly injections of intravitreal bevacizumab, and 2 (9.1%) eyes requiredfurther treatment up to 6 months. The mean+/-SD logarithm of the minimum angle ofresolution (logMAR) BCVA at baseline was 0.60+/-0.18 (Snellen equivalent, 20/80).At 1 and 6 months, the mean+/-SD logMAR BCVA improved significantly to 0.43(Snellen equivalent, 20/53; P = 0.003) and 0.35 (Snellen equivalent, 20/45;P<0.001), respectively. The mean lines of improvements at 1 and 6 month compared with baseline were 1.7 and 2.6 lines, respectively. Fifteen (68.2%) eyes had animprovement of 2 or more lines at 6 months. The OCT results also showedsignificant reduction in CFT after treatment. No ocular or systemic complicationswere noted after intravitreal injections.CONCLUSIONS: The 6-month outcomes suggest intravitreal bevacizumab to be apromising treatment method for CNV secondary to PM, resulting in both visual and anatomic improvements. Treatment resulted in complete absence of angiographicleakage in 90.9% of eyes at 3 months.

The primary endpointwas change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at month 12, while centralretinal thickness (CRT) on optical coherence tomography (OCT), neovascularizationactivity on fluorescein angiography, the number of aflibercept injectionsadministered, and safety were examined as secondary endpoints.RESULTS: Patients received a mean of 2.6 intravitreal aflibercept injections overthe 12-month study period. Compared with baseline, BCVA improved significantly atall time points (P<0.05). Mean (standard deviation [SD]) decimal BCVA was 0.2(0.1) at baseline and 0.35 (0.16) at month 12. The greatest improvement in BCVAwas seen within the first 2 months (P=0.01). Mean (SD) CRT on OCT decreased from 285 (62) µm at baseline to 227 (42) µm (P=0.01) at month 12. There was acontinuous decrease in mean CRT on OCT over time. No cases of endophthalmitis,uveitis, stroke, or retinal detachment were noted. No patient demonstrated anintraocular pressure >20 mmHg during any study visit.CONCLUSION: The 12-month results of intravitreal aflibercept for myopic CNV usingan as-needed regimen were positive, showing benefits in visual and anatomicoutcomes and an acceptable tolerability profile.DOI: 10.2147/OPTH.S117791 PMCID: PMC5106219PMID: 27853350 Conflict of interest statement: The authors report no conflicts of interest inthis work.

The disease has a profoundeffect on quality of life of affected individuals and represents a majorsocioeconomic challenge for societies due to the exponential increase in lifeexpectancy and environmental risks. Advances in medical research have identified vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as an important pathophysiologicalplayer in neovascular AMD and intraocular inhibition of VEGF as one of the mostefficient therapies in medicine. The wide introduction of anti-VEGF therapy hasled to an overwhelming improvement in the prognosis of patients affected byneovascular AMD, allowing recovery and maintenance of visual function in the vastmajority of patients. However, the therapeutic benefit is accompanied bysignificant economic investments, unresolved medicolegal debates about the use ofoff-label substances and overwhelming problems in large population management.The burden of disease has turned into a burden of care with a dissociation ofscientific advances and real-world clinical performance. Simultaneously,ground-breaking innovations in diagnostic technologies, such as optical coherencetomography, allows unprecedented high-resolution visualisation of diseasemorphology and provides a promising horizon for early disease detection andefficient therapeutic follow-up. However, definite conclusions from morphologicparameters are still lacking, and valid biomarkers have yet to be identified toprovide a practical base for disease management. The European Society of RetinaSpecialists offers expert guidance for diagnostic and therapeutic management ofneovascular AMD supporting healthcare givers and doctors in providing the beststate-of-the-art care to their patients.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01318941.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Intravitreal treatment with substances targeting all isotypes of vascularendothelial growth factor (VEGF), for the first time in the history of AMDtreatments, results in a significant increase in visual acuity in patients withneovascular AMD. Overall, antiangiogenic approaches provide vision maintenance inover 90% and substantial improvement in 25-40% of patients. The combination with occlusive therapies like photodynamic therapy (PDT) potentially offers areduction of re-treatment frequency and long-term maintenance of the treatmentbenefit. Further developments interacting with various steps in the angiogeniccascade are under clinical or preclinical evaluation and may soon becomeavailable. Nevertheless, the growing number of novel therapeutic options willhave to provide proof of concept in randomized controlled clinical trials, amajor challenge in view of the rapidly evolving field. For those therapies, whichare already in clinical use, reasonable diagnostic tools for follow-up need to bedeveloped, as the burden of continuous clinical monitoring of all patients andall indications is significant for patients and doctors.

Infants who were administeredranibizumab or aflibercept as initial treatment and completed at least 1 year of corrected age were included. The patients were evaluated in terms of regression, progression or recurrence of the disease, vascularization of the peripheralretina, and ocular complication profile in early or late period.RESULTS: Fifty-four eyes of 27 infants who received ranibizumab treatment(ranibizumab group) and 72 eyes of 36 infants who received aflibercept treatment (aflibercept group) were enrolled. The rate of recurrence was 48.1% inranibizumab group and 13.9% in aflibercept group. The mean recurrence times were at 8.2 ± 0.92 weeks following the injection of ranibizumab and at14.2 ± 1.03 weeks following the injection of aflibercept. There were significant statistical differences between the groups in the rate of ROP recurrence, thetime of recurrence, and the time of vascularization of peripheral retina(p = 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively).CONCLUSION: Although both ranibizumab and aflibercept are effective therapies forthe treatment of ROP, more frequent and much earlier recurrences can be seen withranibizumab treatment. Further studies are needed to obtain ideal options for thetreatment of ROP.DOI: 10.1007/s00417-018-4168-5 PMID: 30397793  [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Serum and plasma samples were collected prior to andup to 12 weeks after IVB or IVA treatment. The serum and plasma VEGF levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), and the plateletlevels in the blood were also quantified. The serum and plasma levels of VEGF, aswell as the ratio of VEGF to platelet count (VEGF/PLT) were measured prior to andup to 12 weeks after anti-VEGF treatment.RESULTS: In total, 14 patients with type 1 ROP were enrolled in this study; five patients received IVA, and nine patients received IVB. Following either IVA orIVB treatment, all the eyes (100%) showed complete resolution of ROP-inducedabnormal neovascularization and presented continued vascularization toward theperipheral retina. Compared to baseline, the serum VEGF levels were significantlyreduced in the ROP patients up to 12 weeks after either IVA or IVB treatments(all P < 0.05). At 2, 4, and 8 weeks after intravitreal injection, the serum VEGFlevels were more suppressed in the IVB group than in the IVA group (P = 0.039,P = 0.004, and P = 0.003, respectively). The serum VEGF/PLT ratio after IVA orIVB showed similar reductions and trends as the serum VEGF data. Changes in theplasma VEGF levels could not be properly assessed because some of the samples hadVEGF levels below the detection limit of the ELISA.CONCLUSIONS: Serum VEGF levels and the VEGF/PLT ratio in patients with type 1 ROPwere suppressed for 3 months after treatment with either IVA or IVB, but thesuppression of systemic VEGF was more pronounced in patients treated with IVBthan those treated with IVA.DOI: 10.1007/s00417-017-3878-4 PMID: 29290015  [Indexed for MEDLINE]

A literature search of peer reviewed reports on PubMed was performed. Morethan 50 pertinent peer-reviewed publications between 2006 and 2014 were selected to be included in this review and are summarized in this report. There is agrowing body of literature on the use of anti-VEGF therapy as a treatment forROP, predominately in the form of case reports and small case series. Adverseeffects from anti-VEGF treatment for ROP have been reported, but with limitedfollow-up time. The use of anti-VEGF as a treatment for ROP remains off-label.Copyright 2015, SLACK Incorporated.DOI: 10.3928/01913913-20150216-01 PMID: 25798707  [Indexed for MEDLINE]

Helen.A.Mintz-Hittner@uth.tmc.eduROP remains a major cause of childhood blindness worldwide. The smallest, sickestinfants develop the most severe forms of zone 1 ROP. Such eyes may not besuccessfully treated by near confluent laser to the avascular retina (currentstandard of care). With an understanding of ROP pathogenesis, vascularendothelial growth factor inhibitors (anti-VEGF) are being given only when VEGFis elevated in retina and vitreous. Careful screening allows proper timing ofadministration. Ideal dose (perhaps different for mild and severe cases) and drug(interrupting only pathologic neovascularization and not normal angiogenesis)remain unproven. The author discusses controversial use of anti-VEGF withdocumented efficacy, observed local complications, and potential systemictoxicities (none observed in six years) to allow retention of vision for severezone 1 ROP. The benefits have been demonstrated, however, local and systemicrisks in these developing premature infants must be carefully studied (both shortand long term).Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
