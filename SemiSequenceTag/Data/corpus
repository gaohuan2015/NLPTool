Sometimes it is better to just walk away from things and go back to them later when you’re in a better frame of mind
Writing a list of random sentences is harder than I initially thought it would be
Where do random thoughts come from?
Lets all be unique together until we realise we are all the same
I will never be this young again
Ever  Oh damn… I just got older
If I don’t like something, I’ll stay away from it
I currently have 4 windows open up… and I don’t know why

It’s really not as bad as it sounds

It didn’t and they don’t recommend anyone else do it either
Sometimes, all you need to do is completely make an ass of yourself and laugh it off to realise that life isn’t so bad after all
When I was little I had a car door slammed shut on my hand
I still remember it quite vividly
i ordered the chicken and waffles and i really liked it
i asked for some butter for my waffle because it didnt come with any and it made the dish perfect for me
the chicken had great flavor and when you take a bite with the waffle and butter and the syrup, heaven
i tried some bites without the butter and it wasnt even close to be the same for me
my grandma got some omellete and she gave me some because she knew she wouldnt finish it and i would order that also
the omelletes are pretty good size but my wifes dish, my sons and mine where not that much food especially for $9
we are use to getting enough food for 2 when you eat at breakfast places and slighty cheaper
not complaining because it was good but be ready
there was 2 guys sitting next to use and trying to eat there 30 minute food challange
big ass egg plate with bacon and hash browns, they both only made thru about halfway
i would definilty go back and get the same stuff
i also got a lemonade with mint and it was just right
my son really didnt like his reese's pancakes
going further inside in an attempt to avoid the high volume of the band whose audio was piped in throughout the restaurant (i failed) i realized shortly that i must of been missed siting in the middle of the dinning are as the wait staff moved smartly from the kitchen to the front delivering the drinks and food to the patrons
i ask a member of the staff was i sitting in the wrong area and soon service was rendered
food, nothing special but it is more of a bar than a restaurant
salvadoreno popped up in a search of mine to find a low-key, nice sunday night place to relax and enjoy some food
it definitely was worth the visit to an interesting part of mesa
the restaurant is very similar to a lot of mexican food restaurants anyone who has lived in phoenix will be familiar with
one room with several tables and a counter with interestingly-named dishes posted behind it
the waitress was very friendly, but i will say that knowing a little spanish helped
my girlfriend and i both ordered the pupusa combo platter, real risky based on other reviews
i went with pollo and the revuelta mixed with pork, cheese and beans
she had the chicken as well with carne asada
this little dish is fantastic
the only disappointment was the fact that independence day was on the tv in spanish, but the volume was too far down to hear
on a more serious note, i look forward to heading back here as soon as possible
i'd love to try the ceviche, as it's on the best of phoenix list, and there are a few other dishes (think breakfast) that looked intriguing
the chocolate cappuccino rocks my world and perks me right the hell up, even on the mushiest afternoon
no bitterness, not overly sweet, just blissful- in an i've-just-been-bitch-slapped-by-caffeine sort of way, of course 
oh, and the sandwiches i complained about? replaced by real deli looking ones in clam-shells
far more appetizing
but what the hell do i need a sandwich for when i can have a giant red velvet cupcake
there is a book on the desk
there is a plane on the desk
there is a book in the desk
