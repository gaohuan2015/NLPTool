Lithuanian politicians tend to refuse commenting on the link in an effort to protect the relations, however, sources close to the government have told BNS that Poland was blocking or putting off projects key to Lithuania and the rest of the Baltics to demand discounts for railway haulage of Orlen Lietuva's cargo.
Lithuania and Poland should shortly open talks on one of the most important energy projects of the decade, i.e., the synchronization of Baltic power networks with continental Europe.
Orlen Lietuva assumes it is not treated equally and does not want to pay more than other Lithuanian Railways' customers.
He also noted that Poland viewed the synchronization of power grids and a second electricity link with Lithuania from an entirely different angle – with the projects completed, stopping flow of cheap electricity from the Nordic flow will not be possible.
Lithuania's ex-minister of economy Kestutis Dauksys, a member of the parliamentary Energy Commission, also did not rule out that the pushing of GIPL could be a political decision made by Poland under the disguise of route revision.
"Energy and politics are closely related.
If you need to find a reason, you will find one.
(...) There can also be technical aspects, as this is a big project," said Dauksys.
Lithuania's Transport and Communications Minister Rimantas Sinkevicius acknowledged he had heard hints from the Lithuanian Energy Ministry to speed up the negotiations between Lietuvos Gelezinkeliai and Orlen Lietuva, which, in his opinion, have an effect on energy projects.
"The problem lies in the money – one side wants cheaper services, while the other wants a profit.
The maximum gap was fantastic at over EUR 200 million," said the minister.
Lithuanian Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius told BNS Lithuania last week that the government would not accept Orlen's demands if that might plunge the railway operator into losses, adding it would be a crime.
"There must be a legal justification behind any discount that comes in violation of an own company's economic interests and starting to operate at a loss.
I can not agree with the idea of loss-making operations for the sake of some other objectives.
I can not make this decision, as it would not make sense," Sinkevicius told BNS Lithuania on Monday.
Relations between the companies went sour in 2014 following the government's decision to change how infrastructure fees are calculated. As a result of this decision, fees for dangerous goods, including oil products, increased.
Fall in competitiveness index is warning that hasty political decisions have been made - Reizniece-Ozola RIGA, Sept 28 (LETA) - Latvia's drop in the Global Competitiveness Index is a warning that hasty and thoughtless political decisions have been made, Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Greens/Farmers) told LETA.
The minister pointed out that the index points out to the fact that the main hurdle for the competitiveness of business activities in Latvia are taxes, even though in previous years the main hurdle was believed to be bureaucracy.
''Dissatisfaction on tax rates and tax legislation as a whole has been growing significantly.
Now, the government is going in the right path by announcing tax policy changes in a timely matter, and discussing them," Reizniece-Ozola emphasized.
On the other hand, speaking about the other indicators in the index, the finance minister admitted that there have been improvements in these areas (healthcare, education etc.
''Overall, this Competitiveness Index serves as a warning for us that hasty political decisions have been made, which have left their impact on the country's overall growth.
Furthermore, these indexes are read by potential foreign investors, who see the figures, but do not know why Latvia has a specific grade in the various categories.
In any case, we must learn from our mistakes," Reizniece-Ozola added.
"Apparently a wider debate is necessary about how to improve the quality of the education process to allow one to obtain secondary education as quickly as possible," Vejonis said.
The Education and Science Ministry has submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers amendments to the Education Law which foresee children to begin obligatory basic education from the age of six, while at the same time allowing for legal conditions for children to begin schooling a year later.
However, the government will not discuss the proposal for now.
Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis (Greens/Farmers) said earlier that the proposal should not be considered as part of the legislative package about the 2017 national budget which would be treated as urgent.
This is a sensitive matter therefore the Education and Science Ministry's proposal should be discussed in the usual procedure, starting with a discussion at the meeting of state secretaries, the prime minister said.
Trump is not capable of immersing himself in various issues and coming up with realistic solutions - expert RIGA, Sept 28 (LETA) - During Monday's first televised U.S. presidential debate, Republican candidate Donald Trump once again showed that he is not capable of immersing himself in various issues where he does not have any direct business interests, Andris Banka, researcher at the Latvian Institute of International Affairs, told LETA.
He also pointed out that in recent weeks, after replacing his campaign manager, Trump showed that with minimal discipline and keeping to prepared speeches and avoiding scandalous and racists remarks, he is capable of increasing his popularity.
''This debates format - 90 minutes on various topics - was very favorable to Clinton, who has much greater experience in such situations.
If Trump was initially able to formulate some kind of position on economic matters at the beginning of the debate, then when discussing foreign policy and racial matters he once again demonstrated to he is not capable of being alone on a stage and offer realistic solutions," the expert said.
He also emphasized that when compared to Clinton, who has always been able to properly prepare for her debates and clearly express her position in detail, Trump looked helpless as he proved that he lacks a good knowledge of his own political platform.
He emphasized that Trump has not yet lost this election, but added that taking into account his performance on Monday and inability to clearly formulate his policy positions, it is hard to see how he will be able to change how he presents himself in such a short period of time.
Monday's presidential debate was the first of three scheduled, with the next two taking place on October 9 in St Louis, and the final one taking place on October 19 in Las Vegas.

Augusts Brigmanis, chairman of the Greens/Farmers Saeima group, earlier said that he had met many businessmen, including farmers, who said they were appalled at how much their electricity bills had increased recently.
"In the past, any consumer could apply for such connection capacity that he or she could possibly need in the future.
The entire distribution network is worth approximately EUR 3 billion and Sadales Tikls has to maintain the network, which is why we want to achieve that people consume as much electricity as they actually need.
This should prompt consumers to consider what connection capacity they actually need," explained the minister.
But the first thing is to decide what to do with those consumers that do not consume electricity at all, although they are connected to the grid, said the minister.
"We have to realize, through talks with farmers and Agriculture Minister Janis Duklavs (Greens/Farmers), where the problem is.
For instance, one agricultural company did not even know that it had eleven functioning connections, and that they could be optimized in order to reduce electricity cost," said the minister.

Pensioners hope economic breakthrough could improve their material situation RIGA, Sept 29 (LETA) - A substantial improvement in the material situation of pensioners depends on just two factors: Latvia's economic growth and the amount of taxes and social contributions paid by taxpayers, Latvian Pensioners Federation's head Andris Silins says in an interview with LETA.
"The fact that about 300,000 economically active people have left Latvia means that pensioners receive just three-quarters or even two-thirds of what they could actually receive.
If there is no economic breakthrough, all that we can hope for is that people will dutifully pay taxes, which is what we are currently fighting for.
As a matter of fact, there are no other options.
At the moment, 38 percent of employees have their taxes paid from the minimum wage, or even smaller amounts," emphasizes Silins.

The risk of poverty is increasing for the older generation, and the federation has concluded that the most effective way to solve this problem would be to increase additional payments for those who retired before 1996 and currently receive, in addition to their pensions, one euro for each year in employment.

On August 9 this year, the government approved the route of the Rail Baltica railroad through Latvia, except railroad's section in Salacgriva, which is to be decided in consultation with the European Commission.
The Lithuanian government is planning to support the Rail Baltica route from Kaunas to the border with Latvia in December, Lithuanian Transport and Communications Ministry's representative Nerijus Kaucikas told reporters today.

Solutions needed to reduce the number of low-skilled workers in Latvia - Aseradens RIGA, Oct 5 (LETA) - There are 300,000 low-skilled workers in Latvia at the moment, who will not be needed on the labor market in the near future, and that is a problem that Latvia has to solve somehow, Economics Minister Arvils Aseradens (Unity) said at a meeting of Saeima Education, Culture and Science Committee today.
The Economics Ministry's goal is to increase economic growth from 2 percent to 5 percent of gross domestic product.
Economic growth is a major precondition for halting economic emigration and prompting re-emigration, said the minister.
The large number of low-skilled workers in Latvia is due to a fundamental problem in the education system.
For instance, one-third of high school graduates fail to become university students, and as a result, thousands of young people join the "army of low-skilled workers" every year.
To change this, these young people should go to vocational schools, explained the minister.
Given that the Baltic market is very saturated, competition is tough.
The Latvian market is growing the fastest, Lithuania is second, while Estonian market growth is slower.
In any case, there is no huge growth, although all market players are ambitious.
However, it is impossible to predict whether competition will become tougher yet in the next few years, she added.
Latvia's fuel market is growing the fastest in the Baltics because, following Russia's sanctions, logistics of deliveries have changed - which had a positive effect on fuel consumption, plus Latvia has lower excise tax rates than, for instance, Estonia.
Estonia is increasing the excise tax on fuel, and will most probably increase it further next year, and that can be seen in fuel consumption figures for Latvia, said Taskinen.
Regardless of the market situation, small fuel retailers also have a future in the Baltics, believes Taskinen.
There is always room for operators that offer good quality.

Purchase price of milk continues to rise; only 1% of dairy farmers have discontinued their activities this year - Agriculture Ministry RIGA, Oct 5 (LETA) - After two years of falling prices, the purchase price of milk, despite the ongoing crisis within the sector, continues to increase the past several months, representatives from the Agriculture Ministry said during a Saeima European Affairs Committee meeting today.
''The increase in the purchase price of milks is due to several external factors - a substantial increase in demand in China, where two-year reserves have been used up, as well as the fact that Russia is buying more milk on international markets.
Furthermore, traditional dairy manufacturing countries like, for example, New Zealand, had a relatively weak season.

''I saw first-hand how gradually many of these persons without any kind of political education - actors, doctors, musicians, bartenders, zoo workers and people with considerable debt that are easy to buy off - how they thought not about Latvia's welfare, but their own pockets ."
''I believe that the greatest misfortune the state has faced the past 25 years is the rise of these two criminal groups, who were not gangsters or racketeers, but our own people, who became legitimate thieves and created these two criminal groups which still exist to this day.
I would not have written this chapter, but because of these two criminal groups I was forced to sell my companies and move to Australia for two and a half years.
Andris' criminal group was formed in Valmiera, while Aivars' criminal group - in Ventspils," Krumins writes.

Poga wants Riga Concert Hall to become orchestra's residence RIGA, Oct 6 (LETA) - It is important for the Latvian National Symphony Orchestra (LNSO) that a new concert hall in Riga become the orchestra's residence, the chief conductor and artistic director of LNSO Andris Poga stressed in an interview with LETA.
"For us the main goal is for the concert hall project to become a residence of the orchestra, otherwise we simply will not support these kinds of projects.
He is certain that the regional concert halls have opened the eyes and ears of musicians and listeners, and proved that music needs to be played in a real concert hall. The Great Guild Hall is not quite suitable for the purpose.
The wardrobes are very small and in awful conditions.
Also the musicians need practice rooms, because not every musician can practice at home.
In terms of comfort of the orchestra and the quality of concerts, a concert hall is necessary in Riga - a place for the listener to go and enjoy classical music.
As reported, the Ministry of Culture has submitted an informative report to the government which suggests that the Cabinet of Ministers should agree upon a solution for the national concert hall.
This solution suggests that the concert hall will be built using state funds, which would be at least EUR 100 million.
"We do n't think that in the near future we will be able to give this kind of money for the project, taking into account the priorities for the coming years," Minister of Culture Dace Melbarde previously said in a radio interview.
The second option is reconstruction of the Riga Congress Center, property of Riga City Council.
The third suggested option is a public-private partnership, where a private partner would be chosen in a tender and given the chance to receive financing from the European Union funds.
The Ministry of Culture believes that the most realistic and fastest way for Riga to have an acoustic concert hall is for this project to be carried out in a public-private partnership.

"I would be lucky to align myself with either one.
The amount of attention I received was flattering, but right now I am letting my agents handle the business side of things ."
Poland offers tank company to join Canadian battle group in Latvia next year RIGA, Oct 6 (LETA) - Poland has offered a tank company to join the Canadian battle group to be deployed to Latvia, as the Polish Embassy in Riga confirmed to LETA.

If the trend persists, prices of milk and dairy products in stores will also be growing, explained Gulbe.
Krumins has not answered when LETA has tried to reach him on his telephone, however, he told Latvian Television and Latvian Radio after he was released this morning that the CPB is looking for"furuncles" and the bureau"is not engaging in normal activities".

Now they are looking for reasons why I donated to this party," the millionaire said.

''I believe that the greatest misfortune the state has faced the past 25 years is the rise of these two criminal groups, who were not gangsters or racketeers, but our own people, who became legitimate thieves and created these two criminal groups which still exist to this day.
I would not have written this chapter, but because of these two criminal groups I was forced to sell my companies and move to Australia for two and a half years.
Andris' criminal group was formed in Valmiera, while Aivars' criminal group - in Ventspils," Krumins writes.
''My first squabble with Andris was when he became prime minister.
Up until Andris came to power, I participated in every tender to supply fuel to Latvian companies - Latvijas Dzelzcels, Autobusu Park, ferries, the Latvian armed forces, etc. I was able to offer the most competitive price, as my terminal was located in central Riga.
Then the minister told me that I have to get ready to be put in jail.
Andris had told him over breakfast that he indeed intends to put me in jail, to which the minister answered - I know more about your deeds and misdeeds than the of Krumins, and then you both will be able to sit in jail.
It turns out, Andris secretly owned most or all shares in the Ziemelu Nafta oil company, which also participated in this tender and had hoped to win.
Thank god this minister was my friend, and is the bravest and most honest person I know.
Three days before the final vote of approval, I got a call from Freeport of Riga CEO Leonids Loginovs that the final vote could be negative and that I had to arrive quickly for a meeting.
At this meeting, I found at that the head of the City Council's Development Department, whose name begins with an E, had told Loginovs to obtain a USD two million bribe from me if I wanted to build the terminal at Kundzinsala.
I immediately called Juris Savickis, the president of Itera, to meet.
His business partner Ainars Gulbis was also present at the meeting.
I asked for their support, for them to talk to Andris and tell them that I will pay the USD 2 million when the terminal will be built and I will begin to pump oil into it.
I can not imagine that a wolf can be allowed to protect sheep.
It is clear E is just a bloody dog on a leash for his master, and these are just the several episodes involving me, but there is also the airBaltic scandal, the digital television scandal, as well as many more which the press has written about ad nauseam.
They did not create anything themselves!
Absolutely nothing !".
Oh the many nicknames he has had - Napoleon, the stetson hat, duke, but in my view - just a regular thug, who as a former local Communist official became mayor of Ventspils in the early 1990's, which was a gold mine of the transit world at the time.
Ventspils had very good relations with Russia, and the mayor was successful in ruining this relationship the past 25 years.
Maybe if this person was a bit taller and could see a bit further, then I am 99 percent confident Russia would not have developed its own terminal in St Petersburg, but would have constructed another three pipelines to this port and even the Nordstream pipeline might be going to Germany via Ventspils.
But in the end, a person who is used to crawling can not fly!," Krumins went on to write in his memoirs.
''Today, no law enforcement institution will even touch these cases, as all of these institutions are elected.
''Lembergs has his political agents in each political party, as he understands that he does not have to sponsor specific parties, but specific politicians.
''How long will these two continue to rule in Latvia?
I am not authorized to take them to court, but these two continue to place their henchmen in positions of power and call themselves officials, while at the same time doing everything they can to please their masters and their business interests.
Thanks to him, all of my projects between 2000 and 2008 were turned down, and myself, who was prepared to start new businesses and create new jobs, had nothing else to do but leave.
I know many other businessmen who were similarly humiliated and were not able to develop their business, but were instead asked to hand over 30 to 60 percent of the shares in their businesses.
Porcelain will be available at the bank's cashier offices as of next Tuesday, October 11, the Latvian central bank said on its official website.

"In September, the price rate of change will again be determined mainly by seasonal fluctuations.
This factor will also influence food prices, whose rate of change will largely determine the September inflation.
But monthly inflation is not expected to change much.
The heating price remained unchanged, and fuel prices changed insignificantly," the SEB economist said.
This can be seen most directly in fuel prices which dropped 10.2 percent in August, but in September they will be only 4 percent lower than a year ago.
Compared to August, the fuel prices will have risen by 2 percent," Abolins said, adding that similar trends can be seen also in other countries and that the eurozone's inflation rose 0.4 percent in September.

As reported, consumer prices in Latvia this past August, compared to July, reduced by 0.7 percent, but did not change against August 2015.

''Krumins' comments do not surprise me.
What he has said is pure fiction, as I have never had any dealing with this person.
I can say he certainly was surprised when the People's Party rejected his offer to sponsor the party, which was due to his questionable reputation," Skele said.
''I saw first-hand how gradually many of these persons without any kind of political education - actors, doctors, musicians, bartenders, zoo workers and people with considerable debt that are easy to buy off - how they thought not about Latvia's welfare, but their own pockets ."

The total renovated area is 25,123 square meters. More than 20 units of road construction machinery and approximately 50 road construction workers were involved in repairing the taxiways, working both day and night hours so that they would not affect the airport's operations.
"At airports this construction is much thicker, because the load is much bigger on taxiways.
On highways the asphalt is 10-25 centimeters thick, depending on intensity. While taxiways' asphalt thickness is the same, the lower, gravel layer is thicker, and in some places underneath the asphalt there is a layer of concrete, its thickness differs in each project.
Last year the company worked with a EUR 61,848,279 turnover and EUR 683,137 profit.
The Riga International Airport is the biggest air traffic hub in the Baltic States.
Coalition members still have not agreed on which healthcare financing model to support RIGA, Oct 7 (LETA) - Ruling coalition members have still not agreed on which of the healthcare financing models, proposed by the Health Ministry, they should support.
The government is to vote on the matter next week.
Solvita Aboltina, head of Unity's Saeima group, believes that none of the proposals of the Health Ministry can be supported, as they do not offer a specific solution to problems with financing for healthcare.
Aboltina emphasized that reforms were necessary, and compulsory health insurance should be considered.
Saeima Public Health Subcommittee's head Romualds Razuks (Unity) explained that none of the models suggested by the Health Ministry envisaged an additional financing source for healthcare.
Healthcare requires an additional EUR 300 million at the very least, so Latvia could at least attain Lithuania's level, but there is no reason to believe that the government would have this money all of a sudden one day.
The National Alliance will formulate its position on Monday, October 10.
The other model included in the Health Ministry's conceptual report is based on compulsory private insurance contributions.

Bank analysts expect inflation rate in Latvia to pick up in following months RIGA, Oct 10 (LETA) - The inflation rate is set to pick up in Latvia in the following months of this year, the surveyed bank analysts predicted.
Like in August, the main trends were brought about by seasonal factors, which pushed up prices for clothing and footwear, food and nonalcoholic beverages, as well as various other goods and services.
Meanwhile, prices dropped for alcohol and tobacco, as well as transport-related goods and services.
The inflation rate will only accelerate in the following months, reaching approximately 1.5 percent in December and jumping above 2 percent at the beginning of next year.
Nordea Bank economist Gints Belevics noted that as the decline in the oil price was gradually losing its influence on consumer prices, the first significant inflation figures have been recorded in Latvia this year.
"We have escaped the deflation zone already since July, and mainly thanks to a rise in food prices as well as costlier health care, recreation, cultural and transportation services, we will spend the remaining months of this year with moderate inflation, which in some moments may exceed 1 percent," Belevics said.
We are likely to see slight inflation until the end of this year, but it will not compensate for the deflation we have been seeing earlier, Vildava said, adding that this year Latvian consumer prices are likely to remain at last year's level.
During the last 12 months, consumer prices in September moved down 0.2 percent as compared to the previous 12 months.

Rail Baltica is a project of great strategic significance, important to all three nations participating in the project, as well as - hopefully - Finland and Poland, said Walker.
The British rail industry is active all over the world.
British companies consider themselves competitive and offer a broad range of professional services, consultants, suppliers, technology, said Walker.
Therefore British companies could contribute to the Rail Baltica project by offering their skills and expertise.
When asked to comment how Brexit could affect the British rail industry's plans concerning Rail Baltica, taking into consideration that construction of Rail Baltica is to begin after 2020, Walker said he hoped that the European Union and Great Britain would reach the best agreement possible.
Therefore the agreement has been signed by all nine parties involved in the project - RB Rail, Estonian Economic Affairs and Communications Ministry, Latvian Transport Ministry, Lithuanian Transport and Communications Ministry, Rail Baltic Estonia, Estonian Technical Regulatory Authority, Eiropas Dzelzcela linijas, Rail Baltica Statyba, and Lietuvos Gelezinkeliai.
The project is expected to facilitate regional integration by means of a railway link from Helsinki that would link Tallinn, Riga, Kaunas, Warsaw and Berlin and might potentially be extended to Venice.

Strasbourg, 11 October 2016 – “In recent months, I have been discussing with the Russian authorities my intention to visit the Russian Federation in the third week of October to focus on several pressing human rights issues.
It is with deep regret that I have to announce that this visit will not take place because of the unacceptable restrictions that the Russian authorities wanted to impose on my programme.
In particular, the proposed restriction of the visit to approximately 48 hours in Moscow alone, with only one full working day, would have not allowed sufficient time to carry out a substantive country visit as I do in all Council of Europe member states, where I meet the authorities, national human rights institutions, civil society, and other relevant interlocutors, and I visit places of human rights relevance including outside the capital.
As I told the Russian authorities, it is deeply disturbing and highly regrettable that these requirements are not fulfilled by the authorities of the Russian Federation today.

Guy Ritchie set to direct live-action Aladdin The Guardian The latest of Disney’s live action adaptations is set to be directed by the Snatch film-maker.
Dan Lin, who produced the two Richie-directed Sherlock Holmes movies starring Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law, promises an “ambitious and non-traditional” take on Aladdin, according to the Hollywood Reporter.
Big Fish writer John August has written the script, which is said to include many of the musical elements from the original, but is non-linear in its structure – much like Ritchie’s two earliest successes, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch.
On top of the Sherlock Holmes franchise, Richie made The Man From UNCLE, based on the popular spy series, and is now in postproduction on King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, an update on the Camelot legend, set for release in March.

Colombia's Uribe presents proposals for peace accord changes Colombia's former President Alvaro Uribe on Monday proposed that leaders of the Marxist FARC rebel group lose their freedom for at least five years and they would be banned from elected office as part of changes to a peace deal between the government and the insurgents.
Uribe opposed FARC leaders receiving non-traditional sentences like clearing landmines, and instead insisted that those found guilty of war-time crimes should lose their freedom for between five and eight years even if they are held on agricultural farms.
Although the FARC has said it is willing to hear new ideas, Uribe's proposals may be difficult for its leadership to accept, given they have repeatedly refused to consider jail time and they want to form a political party.
Uribe, who scored major military gains against the FARC when he was president, fought against the negotiations since Santos began the peace talks in 2012, describing them as far too lenient on rebel leaders and a national embarrassment.
Santos said they must move quickly to present the new ideas to the FARC.
Those involved in serious crimes would have been restricted to certain areas for eight years.

Today "Bosnia and Herzegovina is a place that nobody wants except few idealists in Sarajevo who want to preserve it," he said, adding that "from a rational point of view nobody benefits from it ."

"Sometimes as an actor I wish I could start my career over," Kutcher said in a recent interview with The Associated Press, "where people do n't know anything about me and I'd never do an interview and I'd never do a talk show because I'd never want them to know anything about me ."
Kutcher's theory is that the less people know about performers' lives, the more believable they are as characters.
Danny Masterson, who was also on "That '70s Show," plays Kutcher's brother on "The Ranch ."

Real Madrid to appeal against EU ruling on'illegal aid' Madrid, Oct 11, 2016 (AFP) - Real Madrid said Tuesday it would appeal against an EU decision requiring the club to repay 18.4 million euros ($20.39 million) in alleged illegal aid from a land deal.
"We are going to file an appeal, and I am absolutely convinced we will win," Real president Florentino Perez told a press conference.
In 1998, the club paid the city 595,000 euros for the land but the deal ultimately fell through because of technical problems.
"It's meaningless when you see it's been carried out by a company from Barcelona that furthermore is tiny and not an expert," he argued.
"There's nothing" in this case, Perez said. "We are going to file an appeal against the European Commission's assessment ."

Kozlovskis gives State Police chief two weeks to determine whether new vehicle procurement was organized according to the law RIGA, Oct 11 (LETA) - Interior Minister Rihards Kozlovskis (Unity) has given State Police Chief Ints Kuzis two weeks to figure out what should be done with the new police vehicles.

Singer Rod Stewart scored a very coveted accessory at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday when he was knighted by Prince William.
The Grammy winner, who was awarded the honor by Queen Elizabeth in a list made public on her official 90th birthday weekend in June, ditched the ceremony’s traditional tailcoat and top hot for tartan trousers, a dark, military-style jacket and scarlet cuffs — his flamboyant stage wear that has been his signature for more than 50 years in showbiz.
At the ceremony, he was introduced in the Ballroom at Buckingham Palace as Sir Roderick Stewart, for services to music and to charity.
When Rod got up, 6-foot 3-inch William towered over him (he stood on a raised platform making their height difference even greater) and placed the ribboned-medal around his neck.

leader Washington (dpa) - Donald Trump escalates his attack on Paul Ryan after he said he would longer defend the Republican party's nominee for president.
"Our very weak and ineffective leader, Paul Ryan, had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty," Trump tweets.
Ryan, the speaker of the House of Representatives, told Republican lawmakers on a conference call Monday that he would no longer campaign for Trump in the wake of the release of a decade-old video in which Trump boasts about sexually assaulting women.

Colombia to launch peace talks with ELN rebels Caracas, Oct 11, 2016 (AFP) - The Colombian government and the country's second-largest rebel group, the ELN, announced Monday they would launch negotiations on October 27 in Ecuador's capital, with President Juan Manuel Santos predicting "total peace ."
Both sides have committed to doing everything in their power to "create an environment favorable to peace" once the talks begin, according to a joint statement delivered at the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry in Caracas.
Colombia and the ELN agreed in March to launch peace talks, in parallel with the government's negotiations with the FARC. But the government has said negotiations with the ELN can not begin until the group frees all its hostages.
Catholic Church sources identified the hostage as Nelson Alarcon, kidnapped three months ago. The ELN is still believed to be holding at least one hostage, according to Colombian authorities.

At least 290 people, mostly civilians, have been killed by government or Russian fire since the operation began on September 22, the Observatory said.

China raps US interventions in Asia at regional forum Beijing, Oct 11, 2016 (AFP) - Beijing rapped Washington Tuesday for its interventions in Asia, as tensions grow between the two powers over territorial disputes in the South China Sea and how to handle increasingly erratic North Korea.
"Some countries seek absolute military superiority, ceaselessly strengthen their military alliances, and seek their own absolute security at the costs of other countries' security," Chang told defence officials and academics at the meeting.
The US under President Barack Obama has sought to "pivot" to Asia by increasing military and economic engagement in the region, raising concerns in Beijing that Washington is working to contain the Asian giant's growing power.
China says it has rights to almost the entire region, while Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, and Taiwan all have rival claims.
In July, an international tribunal said that almost all of Beijing's claims have no legal basis, a decision China attacked as biased and vowed to ignore.

European Court condemns Russia over Kasparov interrogation Strasbourg, France, Oct 11, 2016 (AFP) - The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) condemned Russia on Tuesday for detaining former chess champion and political activist Garry Kasparov ahead of an opposition rally in 2007.
Kasparov had his ticket and passport confiscated and was taken to a police office and questioned for five hours as to whether his ticket had been forged.
He missed his flight and the rally as a result.
"While the authorities claimed they had been investigating Mr Kasparov for committing the crime of forgery, there was no evidence that any forgery had taken place, let alone that the authorities had had a reasonable suspicion that he had committed that offence," the ECHR said.
"Given that his detention had not been lawful or justified, the Court held that he had therefore also been unlawfully prevented from attending the rally ."
It is still possible for KVV Liepajas Metalurgs to resume operations - Velmers RIGA, Oct 12 (LETA) - The insolvent joint-stock metallurgical company KVV Liepajas Metalurgs can still be sold as a single manufacturing plant, and renew its operations, Liepajas Metalurgs insolvency administrator Haralds Velmers told Saeima Public Expenditure and Audit Committee yesterday.
"Of course, renewing production will cost money, but, potentially, it is possible.
How to sell it will be decided by the company's administrator," said Velmers, adding that selling the various facilities of Liepajas Metalurgs "for scrap" would be the last resort.
Financial consulting company Prudentia board chairman Karlis Krastins said that selling a company that has been declared insolvent for the second or third time would be more difficult, as investors would be more skeptical.
"On the other hand, the company has been operating for about a year, turning over EUR 80 million," said Krastins.
When asked by committee members if selling the insolvent Liepajas Metalurgs to investors from Ukraine was the best solution in 2014, Velmers and Krastins both replied in the affirmative.
The situation in the metallurgical industry in Europe was difficult in 2014, and it still remains so to this day, said Krastins.
One of the main reasons why Liepajas Metalurgs' operations were not successful after the company was sold is the fact that modernization of the company had not been completed.
"The company had a very modern furnace but obsolete, soviet-time rolling mill," said Krastins.
As reported, Liepaja Court approved commencing of insolvency proceedings at KVV Liepajas Metalurgs on September 16.

Jesse Eisenberg To Become A Father - Report Actor Jesse Eisenberg is reportedly expecting his first child with longtime love Anna Strout.
Jesse has been notoriously silent when it comes to addressing his private life in public, but in a rare candid moment during a 2011 Seventeen magazine interview, he confessed that Strout was the only woman he had ever had a serious committed relationship with.
He also hinted that humanitarian Anna's commitment to improving society is what has kept him devoted to her for over a decade, adding, "I find people who want to help other people to be the most interesting.
I come from a family of teachers, and my friends are teachers, often times in very difficult school situations.
My job is so selfish and focused on my own vanity that I like to surround myself with people who are actually helping people throughout their day ."
Turkey to revive plans to strengthen Erdogan's office, PM says The Turkish government will soon restart efforts to change the constitution and expand presidential powers, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said on Wednesday, reviving the controversial plan after an opposition leader signaled his support.
A state of emergency imposed in July to root out plotters from the security and civil services has allowed the government to rule by decree.
"Turkey must give the de facto situation a legal status," Yildirim, a loyalist whom Erdogan appointed to the job in May, told members of the ruling AK Party in comments aired live.
The system will help state institutions work more harmoniously and ensure political stability is lasting, he said.
The current charter describes the office as largely ceremonial. "We will at once take steps in this direction and will let either parliament or the people decide," Yildirim said, vowing to work closely with Erdogan to draft the change.
Any constitutional change requires the support of at least 367 deputies in the 550-seat assembly to pass directly.
Parliament's second- and third-biggest parties, the Republican People's Party (CHP) and the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), both oppose ending Turkey's parliamentary system.
The assembly, set up by Prime Minister Enda Kenny to report to parliament, will meet against the backdrop of a growing campaign to repeal the constitution's controversial Eighth Amendment, which equates the rights of an unborn child with those of the mother.
As the Irish law currently stands, abortion is legal only when there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the pregnant woman, including the risk of suicide.
In 2015, 3,451 women and girls went to England from Ireland for abortions, according to British data cited by the Irish Family Planning Association, a sexual health charity.
There have been many high-profile scandals related to the treatment of pregnant women and girls since the Eighth Amendment was passed by referendum in 1983.
Pope begs for immediate ceasefire in Syria Vatican City, Oct 12, 2016 (AFP) - Pope Francis appealed on Wednesday for an immediate ceasefire in Syria, calling for "at least" a truce enabling civilians, especially children, to be evacuated, after Aleppo came under fierce air assault.
"I want to underline and reiterate my closeness to all the victims of the inhumane conflict in Syria," he said at his weekly audience in Saint Peter's Square at the Vatican.
"It is with a sense of urgency that I renew my appeal, begging those responsible, with all my strength, for an immediate ceasefire to be imposed and respected at least long enough to consent the evacuation of civilians, especially children, who are still trapped under the ferocious bombardments," he said.
Syria's army announced a bid last month to retake the city, which has been divided since mid-2012. The assault began after the collapse of a short-lived truce negotiated by Washington and Moscow, and has seen the besieged east of Aleppo come under fierce aerial assault.
France launches Kardashian robbery probe Paris, Oct 12, 2016 (AFP) - French prosecutors have formally opened an investigation into the robbery in Paris of Kim Kardashian in which the US reality TV star lost millions in jewellery, a judicial source said Wednesday.
The investigation is focusing on "armed theft in a gang, criminal conspiracy and kidnapping," the source said.
Police said a gang of five armed men burst into the residence in the early hours of October 3, tied up Kardashian and stole a ring and jewellery worth around nine million euros ($10 million).
Kardashian, 35, who had been attending Paris fashion week, was briefly questioned by police before flying back to New York.
Amendments on noise levels at race tracks have affected quality of life for those who live near race tracks - ombudsman RIGA, Oct 12 (LETA) - Amendments to the regulations on noise levels at race tracks that the government endorsed last year have affected quality of life for those who live near such facilities, Ombudsman Juris Jansons told the LNT television today.
Ombudsman's Office has carried out a survey of noise levels near race tracks, concluding that the amendments, which were drafted by the Environmental Protection and Regional Development Ministry, did not take into consideration the effect they have on people's right to live in healthy environment.
Jansons believes that the regulations violate good governance principles and the Constitution, and have to be changed.
Commenting on the Bikernieki race track in Riga, Jansons said that the race track had to be either moved elsewhere or noise barriers had to be built around the Bikernieki complex.
He said that the situation would be discussed with the Transport Ministry and the Road Traffic Safety Directorate.
According to the Road Traffic Safety Directorate's data, maximum noise pollution levels provided in the Cabinet of Ministers' regulations have not been exceeded at Bikernieki sports complex the past three years.
Activist Roman Huber of the Mehr Demokratie (More Democracy) organisation said that "not a single parliament elected by me -- neither the Bundestag nor the European Parliament -- was given a mandate to negotiate for CETA".
Another complaint was brought by music teacher Marianne Grimmenstein-Balas, whose online petition attracted over 68,000 co-plaintiffs.
Speaking to reporters before the start of the hearing, she said she wanted the deal to be put on hold to allow time "to make reasonable improvements for the good of the general public".
CETA negotiations were formally concluded in 2014 but the deal has since faced fierce opposition across Europe, delaying implementation.
Opponents argue it would hand too much power to multinational companies and undermine consumer and environmental protection standards.
Activists also charge that it will set a dangerous precedent and open the way for a similar but far more ambitious agreement with the United States known as TTIP.
Germany records 213,000 new asylum seekers this year Berlin, Oct 12, 2016 (AFP) - Germany registered 213,000 asylum seeker arrivals in the year's first nine months, a sharp slowdown from the record influx of 2015, Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said Wednesday.
German authorities had ruled on close to 460,000 asylum applications so far this year, de Maiziere said, including many from a backlog in 2015.
The influx slowed sharply after Balkan nations closed the route favoured by migrants to reach Europe and the EU reached an accord with Turkey in March to curb migrant flows.

Local top-level associations have expressed their support for Nahles' legislation.
Chief executive of the City and Municipal Association, Gerd Landsberg, told the "Die Welt" newspaper on Wednesday that Germany's current regulations could make Germany even more attractive to immigrants.
"Freedom of movement within the EU does not mean that EU citizens can choose the social system with the most comprehensive services," Landsberg said.
The new law should prevent abuse of the system and a "certain form of social tourism," he added.
"We need this law now," said Helmut Dedy, chief executive of the German Association of Cities.
The bill also received praise on Wednesday from the Christian Social Union (CSU) - the Bavarian sister party to Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU).
"It's right that Nahles closes the existing gap for uncontrolled immigration into social systems," Bavarian Social Affairs Minister Emilia Müller said.
The Greens commissioned historians Jens Gieseke and Andrea Bahr to study infiltration of their party by the East German secret police, known as the Stasi, the Mitteldeutsche newspaper said.
The book reveals that there were between 15 and 20 informants within the party, of whom some handed over information about the party's day-to-day activities to the Stasi.
The most prominent informant was member of the federal parliament in Berlin, Dirk Schneider, who was revealed to be an East German agent in 1991.
British PM allows MPs to scrutinise Brexit plan London, Oct 12, 2016 (AFP) - British Prime Minister Theresa May signalled ahead of a House of Commons debate Wednesday that she would let parliament scrutinise her plan for Brexit before she begins the formal process to exit the EU.
The move caused the pound to bounce back after a torrid week, amid speculation that MPs may be able to soften the government's approach to Brexit, which currently seems on course to take Britain out of the single market.
May has still offered no reassurance that MPs will have a vote on her plan before she triggers Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty, which formally begins the exit process.
However, it specifies that any parliamentary scrutiny process must respect the vote to leave the EU and should not "undermine the negotiating position of the government".
The party has also given the government 170 questions on the detail of the Brexit plan -- one for every day until the end of March, the deadline May has set for triggering Article 50.
"If you are able to provide satisfactory answers to all these questions, just one per day from tomorrow until 31 March next year, it might give some confidence that the government is entering the Article 50 negotiations with a clear plan," they wrote.
Rinkevics in Bangkok to discuss terrorism and radicalization RIGA, Oct 12 (LETA) - Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics (Unity) will be in Bangkok from today until October 14 to attend that European Union-Association of Southeast Asian Nations (EU-ASEAN) Summit.

US top court to consider post-9/11 detentions of immigrants Washington, Oct 11, 2016 (AFP) - The US Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to consider a lawsuit that accuses former senior government officials of abusive detentions of immigrants rounded up after the September 11, 2001 terror attacks.
At issue is the responsibility of former attorney general John Ashcroft, former FBI director Robert Mueller and other officials of the administration of then-president George W. Bush, who argue they are immune from prosecution.
The plaintiffs say they were targeted because they were Muslims or of Arab descent, and were held for no valid reason.
They recounted abusive detentions, including being held in isolation, deprived of sleep, and subject to insults and physical abuse by guards.
"The Algerian Football Federation have decided to amicably terminate the contract of Milovan Rajevac," the station reported, with the Serb having only replaced Christian Gourcuff in June.

Algeria reached the last 16 of the 2014 World Cup but face a difficult task in qualifying for the tournament in Russia after being drawn alongside Nigeria, Cameroon and Zambia. Only the group winners qualify for the finals.
Kurtulmus warned that the Syrian conflict had put the world "on the brink of the beginning of a large regional or global war".
While Turkey and its Western allies call for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, Moscow is a key backer of the regime in Damascus alongside Iran.
US Secretary of State John Kerry last week called for a war crimes investigation after accusing Moscow and the regime of deliberately bombing hospitals as a Russian-backed assault on Aleppo in northern Syria continues.
In the interview, Kurtulmus also insisted that Turkish forces at the Bashiqa camp in northern Iraq were "legitimate" and would remain in the country for "as long as necessary".
Tensions are high after Baghdad called Ankara an "occupying" force last week when the Turkish parliament agreed to extend its mandate for military operations in Iraq and Syria for a year.
Turkey has said its forces are training Iraqi fighters to help retake the country's second biggest city, Mosul, from IS in the near future.
EU petition on Barroso bank job tops 150,000 Brussels, Oct 12, 2016 (AFP) - The number of people signed up to a petition launched by EU staff demanding that former European commission President Jose Manuel Barroso lose his pension after he took a job with Goldman Sachs on Wednesday reached 152,000.
The decision by Barroso to join Goldman Sachs "is a further example of the irresponsible revolving-door practices, which are highly damaging to the EU institutions and, even if not illegal, morally reprehensible," the petition said.
"It is irresponsible because it feeds into a political context which is not only Eurosceptic but now even openly Europhobic," it added.
French President Francois Hollande labeled Barroso's new job as "morally unacceptable" at the time of his hiring.
This was in violation of EU code of conduct rules that state "commissioners may not engage in any other professional activity, whether gainful or not ."
Many of the submissions deal with social issues, including Yemen's," I Am Nojoom, Age 10 and Divorced ."
Bosnia and Herzegovina chose an examination of a century of European conflict in "Death in Sarajevo" by Danis Tanovic, winner of the Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize at this year's Berlin Film Festival.

Moscow says British FM's Syria comments'Russophobic' Moscow, Oct 12, 2016 (AFP) - Moscow on Wednesday hit out at British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson for accusing Russia of committing war crimes in Syria, dismissing his comments as "Russophobic hysteria ."
Johnson on Tuesday called for protests outside the Russian embassy in London over Moscow's intervention in Syria backing President Bashar al-Assad's regime.
Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said in a statement that Johnson's "accusing Russia of all mortal sins" was just a "storm in a teacup ."
"The Russophobic hysteria that is regularly fuelled by certain members of the British establishment has not been taken seriously for a long time," he said.
Konashenkov said the Russian air force was not responsible for the bombing of a UN convoy in the Aleppo region last month and accused Britain of withholding the evidence it says it has against Russia.

The 44 year old Hollywood A-lister arrived at the TCL Chinese Theatre on Monday night (October 10th) for the star-studded premiere of his new film, but decided to watch his beloved Boston Red Sox on a reporter’s phone as he made his way down the red carpet.
“I'm going to have to take a break, ” Affleck said, taking KTLA reporter Doug Kolk’s phone from him temporarily, “this is agonizing.
I would much rather be watching the game, but this is a job.” He then managed to compose himself before answering a question from USA Today, who asked him about the game.
Last week, the US charged that the Russian government had intentionally interfered with the US presidential election process by directing recent attacks on email systems used by US political organizations.
"They did not prove it," he said.
"It's flattering of course, to get this kind of attention, for a regional power, as President [Barack] Obama called us some time ago," Lavrov said.
"Everybody in the United States is saying that it is Russia which is running the... presidential debate," Lavrov said. "It's flattering, as I said, but it has nothing to be explained by the facts.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and director of national intelligence issued a joint statement Friday saying the US intelligence community is "confident" that the Russian government directed the recent attacks.

Refugees also say that they like Latvia's nature, as the nature in their countries is completely different.
Those who have visited the Baltic Sea speak about it with much excitement.

''I remember that in one of my first groups there was a many with prayer beads in his hands, and I though to myself that he is a fanatical believer of Islam.
It later turns out he instead was the only Christian in the group," the teacher said.
''We understand how important it is to learn Latvian not just in our classes, but also in everyday situations and at work.
''I would like to see more positive stories about integration in Latvia.

Western contact with China began long before Marco Polo, experts say China and the West were in contact more than 1,500 years before European explorer Marco Polo arrived in China, new finds suggest.
They also say ancient Greek artisans could have been training locals there in the Third Century BC.
Polo's 13th Century travel to China had been thought the first by a European.
"We now have evidence that close contact existed between the First Emperor's China and the West before the formal opening of the Silk Road.
Farmers first discovered the 8,000 terracotta figures buried less than a mile from the tomb of China's first emperor Qin Shi Huang in 1974.
"We now think the Terracotta Army, the Acrobats and the bronze sculptures found on site have been inspired by ancient Greek sculptures and art," he said.
"I imagine that a Greek sculptor may have been at the site to train the locals," he said.
I hope it’s not too uncomfortable.

Foreign spies hacked Australian agency, report says Sydney, Oct 12, 2016 (AFP) - Foreign spies installed malicious software on an Australian government agency's computer system, stealing an unknown number of documents, an official report revealed Wednesday, stopping short of naming the country involved.
In 2013 Chinese hackers were accused of stealing the top-secret blueprints of Australia's new intelligence agency headquarters.
The report said the national cyber security agency, Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), had identified the presence of Remote Access Tool (RAT) malware "popular with state-sponsored cyber adversaries" and other malware associated with cyber crime on the weather bureau's system in 2015.
"The RAT had also been used to compromise other Australian government networks," it said.
This information is likely to have been stolen by the adversary ."
The process is controversial though, with rights groups critical of forced repatriations and the stick-and-carrot approach the EU is taking with migrants' countries of origin and transit.
In the case of Tunisia, the EU could relax or eliminate some visa requirements for short-term visitors, at least for some groups of people, according to a statement by the European Commission, the bloc's executive.
"Tunisia could be the first country in North Africa to benefit from an ambitious visa facilitation agreement," EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said.
"At the same time, the conclusion of a readmission agreement will help to avert the risk of irregular immigration from Tunisia, and manage its consequences," he added.
EU member states issued 155,000 short-stay visas for Tunisians in 2015, while 370,000 Tunisians were legally resident in the bloc at the end of the year, according to the commission.
Most lived in France, followed by Italy and Germany.

France's Hollande admits'problem with Islam' Paris, Oct 12, 2016 (AFP) - President Francois Hollande speaks of "a problem with Islam" in French society, in excerpts published Wednesday of a book in which he also suggests that immigration needs to be curbed.
"There is a problem with Islam because Islam requires (holy) sites and recognition," Hollande told two journalists from Le Monde newspaper for the book which will be published Thursday.
A string of jihadist attacks in France in the past two years, coupled with the Europe-wide migrant crisis, have stoked anti-immigration sentiment.
A heated debate about Muslim integration in staunchly secular France came to a head over the summer when around 30 towns banned the body-concealing burkini swimsuit.
France's highest administrative court later ruled that such a ban was a "serious" violation of basic freedoms.
Sarkozy on Sunday said that if elected he would call a referendum asking the French if they backed suspending the right for non-EU nationals to join family members in France -- one of the main channels for immigration to the country.
In the tell-all book, Hollande also attacks Sarkozy's "vulgarity, meanness and cynicism" and criticises the rival he defeated in 2012 for his fascination for money and his legal entanglements.

"The state is imposing them on us," the poster reads.
"Migrants in our town centre ."
The poster put out by Mayor Robert Menard, an ally of the far-right National Front, is a reaction to government plans to relocate thousands of migrants from the north coast to dozens of sites around France.
It is reminiscent of a controversial poster created by leading Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage, former head of Britain's anti-immigration UK Independence Party (UKIP), showing a vast queue of migrants under the slogan "Breaking Point".
SOS Racism has called for the region's governor to step in and stop Menard's planned referendum.
And the government's anti-racism body DILCRA has called on the prosecutor's office in Beziers to investigate what it says is a "flagrant" example of incitement to hatred.
"The repeated targeting of people or groups because of their origin or their beliefs can not be accepted," it said in a statement.
Electricity bills to increase for 390,000 grid connections, decrease for 650,000 connections - Economics Ministry RIGA, Oct 12 (LETA) - As a result of differentiated mandatory procurement component in electricity rates, light bills will increase for about 390,000 power grid connections and decrease for about 650,000 connections, according to the Economics Ministry's estimates.
At the same time, the ministry notes that part of grid connections actually consume no or very little electricity (for instance, summer cottages), and that is one part of consumers for which electricity will become costlier.
As reported, on October 4 the government approved amendments to the Electricity Market Law differentiating compulsory procurement component in electricity rates for energy-intensive companies, based on their connection capacity and electricity consumption volumes.
The changes will prompt consumers to choose more effective connection capacities, as well as increase electricity consumption in Latvia in the long term as they will create more favorable environment for energy-intensive companies.

Padesta added: "We ca n't confirm the accuracy of those leaks, we know that the Russians might have passed on doctored documents ."
"I would say that the Russian interference in this election and their apparent attempt to influence it on behalf of Mr Trump should be of utmost concern to all Americans ."

IS propaganda arm weakened by military setbacks: study Washington, Oct 11, 2016 (AFP) - The IS group's propaganda machine, largely credited with effectively attracting fresh recruits, has been weakened by military setbacks in Iraq and Syria, a US study said Tuesday.
The jihadist group's photo and video dissemination has been cut drastically year over year, research by the West Point military academy's Combating Terrorism Center revealed.
"It is clear that the organization has been forced to cut back these activities in response to the increasing amount of counterterrorism pressure brought to bear against the organization," said the study.
It also noted there were fewer images depicting a well-running jihadist "caliphate" in the form of schools, libraries, police and public services.
"This decline suggests that the group is struggling to maintain the outward appearance of a functioning state," the study said.
Meanwhile, videos showing the execution of spies have increased significantly, demonstrating either "paranoia" amid increasing pressure or challenges from within that are causing a public display of brutality.
"All of this is likely to continue to depress their recruitment efforts, although it does n't completely mitigate the problem," he said.

French FM does not back sanctions against Russia over Syria Rome, Oct 12, 2016 (AFP) - French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said Wednesday he did not support sanctions against Russia or Iran, which back the Syrian regime and its offensive in Aleppo.
He described the situation in Syria as "intolerable", adding that there was no military solution and negotiations were the only way to end the five-year war.

Gerhards says liquidation of Incukalns acid waste ponds will be completed ahead of schedule RIGA, Oct 12 (LETA) - Environmental Protection and Regional Development Minister Kaspars Gerhards (National Alliance) firmly believes that liquidation of acid waste ponds at Incukalns will be completed ahead of schedule.
According to the current plan, the project is to be implemented by 2023, but as the minister told Latvian Radio today, the project could be completed by 2020.
As reported, due to various problems the liquidation of the acid waste pond in Incukalns has been delayed.
It was discovered that the chemical composition of the acid waste is different than previously thought, which caused difficulties in liquidation and increased the cost of the project.
The contract for liquidation of the acid waste ponds was originally signed with Skonto Buve, but last summer the State Environmental Service terminated it.
However, Skonto Buve claimed that the contract termination was unlawful and took the case to court.
The contenders for the project funding are a Belgian company, a Latvian association and the company A.C.B with the German subordinate company MUEG.
During the first stage of the project from 2019 to 2023, the Daugavpils-Krustpils line and the Rezekne-Krustpils line on the route to Ventspils will be electrified.
EUR 347 million worth of EU cohesion funding have been made available for this project for the EU's 2014 to 2020 planning period.
The government will make the final decision on this matter most likely during a Cabinet meeting on October 25.
Austria does not expect to reach immigration limit this year Vienna (dpa) - The number of asylum seekers arriving in Austria will likely stay below the limit of 37,500 that the government set early this year, an Interior Ministry spokesman said Wednesday.
If the influx had surpassed this ceiling, Austria would have triggered emergency measures to reject nearly all asylum seekers at its borders.
Austria took in 90,000 asylum seekers last year, but pressure from the far-right Freedom Party and from public opinion forced the centrist government to adopt restrictive policies early this year.
De Maiziere seeks to further limit asylum exceptions DW Germany's interior minister has drafted legislation to more easily deport rejected asylum applicants, media report.
"If deportation is not possible because the foreigner has, for example, misled authorities about identity or nationality, or is not cooperating with efforts to secure a replacement passport, then he will no longer receive exceptional leave to stay," the draft reportedly says.
De Maiziere and his allies on the right seek to reduce the reasons for granting such waivers, Die Welt reported: For instance, refusals to issue replacement papers by people's countries of origin will no longer work.
The draft law would also increase the time that officials could imprison people who refuse to leave the country - from four days to two weeks.
Trump trails Clinton by 8 points after tape scandal, debate: Reuters/Ipsos poll Donald Trump has fallen further behind Hillary Clinton and now trails her by 8 points among likely voters, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll, with 1 in 5 Republicans saying his vulgar comments about groping women disqualify him from the presidency.
The national tracking poll was launched after Sunday night's second presidential debate, where Trump was pressed to explain his comments in a 2005 videotape about grabbing women's genitalia.
He described the remarks, which first surfaced on Friday, as "locker room" banter and apologized to Americans. The poll released on Tuesday showed Clinton, the Democratic nominee, had increased her lead over Trump, the Republican nominee, to 8 percentage points on Monday from 5 points last week.
Among those who said they watched at least portions of the debate, 53 percent said Clinton won while 32 percent said Trump won.
Most of those polled said they believe Trump is a sexist, but they were split on whether his comments disqualify him from being president. Some 42 percent of American adults, including 19 percent of registered Republicans, said Trump's comments disqualified him, while 43 percent said they did not.
When asked to pick between the two candidates, about 44 percent of women chose Clinton while 29 percent selected Trump - roughly the same proportion as measured in polls conducted before the weekend.

The extended deployment, which must still be signed off on by parliament, is the Bundeswehr's second largest following its Afghanistan mission.
The German forces are based at Turkey's Incirlik NATO base near the Syrian border.

"We do n't think that he will speak and he will use the right to remain silent," said Berton in a joint interview with fellow lawyer Sven Mary.
"In this position what would you like us to do.

Oct 13 (LETA) - Latvian MEP Iveta Grigule (Greens/Farmers) claims that her pre-election campaign had been financed legally.
The politician told LETA that the Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau (KNAB) has inspected expenses and legitimacy of revenues before the European Parliament elections already a year and a half ago, and there had been no remarks for the Union of Greens and Farmers.
Millionaire Julijs Krumins who last week was detained in suspicion of illegal donations to several political parties, in recent interviews with journalists repeatedly said that he had donated money for Grigule's pre-election campaign and did it by directly transferring money to Grigule instead of donating to the party.

The minister noted that next year's budget priorities - defense, security, health care and education - will remain high on the government's agenda also in the future.
"Next year's GDP growth of 3.5 is nowhere near the 5 percent growth target written in the national development plan, but if we look at trends in the global economy, 3.5 percent growth would be one of the best results in Europe," the finance minister said.
Reizniece-Ozola praised the reforms that have been launched in the education system, saying that their benefits will become felt in a couple of years.
The reforms planned in health care will be carried out so that the additional funding allocated for this purpose is spent in accordance with the Health Ministry's plan, which has to ready by the end of this year.
"The fiscal reserve will keep us from spending all the money we have in our pocket and to save a small reserve for contingency purposes," she said.
"Overall, next year's budget revenues and expenditures have exceeded the pre-crisis level.
We must keep in mind, however, that we borrowed in international financial markets during the crisis and that we will have to repay these loans and interest in following years, which will make up a large portion of budget expenditures," the minister said.
As compared to the 2016 budget, revenues are expected to grow by EUR 664 million and expenditures by EUR 681 million next year.

Judge gives Florida voters more time to register after hurricane Florida residents were given six extra days to register to vote in the Nov. 8 election by a U.S. judge on Wednesday following the disruption triggered by powerful Hurricane Matthew in the state last week.
U.S. District Judge Mark Walker in Tallahassee extended the registration deadline to Oct. 18 after the Florida Democratic Party sued to seek more time.
It is the largest of the hotly contested states whose populations can swing either to Republicans or Democrats and thus play a decisive role.
In its complaint, the Florida Democratic Party alleged that the state's refusal to extend the voter registration deadline would have a "decidedly partisan effect," noting that populations that lean Democratic, including minorities and younger voters, register in greater numbers just before the deadline.

Former businesswoman Jessica Leeds, 74, who worked for a paper company, told the Times that Trump groped her on a flight more than three decades ago as they sat next to each other in first class.
About 45 minutes after takeoff, Trump lifted the armrest and began grabbing her breasts and tried to put his hand up her skirt, Leeds said.
Rachel Crooks said she was a 22-year-old receptionist at a real estate company in Trump Tower in 2005 when she encountered Trump outside an elevator in the building one morning.

EU misspent 5.5 bln euros, needs to regain trust: watchdog Brussels, Oct 13, 2016 (AFP) - The EU misspent 5.5 billion euros ($6 billion) in 2015, the bloc's financial watchdog said Thursday, warning that Brussels needed to regain the trust of European citizens shaken by Brexit and other crises.
"People can not even begin to trust us if they do not believe we are looking after their money properly," Lehne said.
The report said the so-called error rate for spending fell slightly to 3.8 percent of the EU's 145.2-billion-euro budget in 2015, but was still far above the acceptable level of 2.2 percent.
The report said the figures were not a measure of fraud, inefficiency or waste, but an estimate of the money that should not have been paid out because it did not fully comply with EU rules.
The total EU budget amounts to around one percent of EU gross national income and around two percent of total public spending in member states, it said.

"I think that is an absolute case in point, whereby I do n't think there is anything about that character that is rooted in white maleness," he says.
"There are going to be people who are going to resist, on the basis of tradition, but I think that's absolutely a character where, from a story point of view, it does n't undercut the story in anyway ."

Rinkevics urges Vietnam to speed up signing of readmission agreement with Latvia to curb illegal immigaration RIGA, Oct 13 (LETA) - Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics (Unity) has called on Vietnam to speed up the signing of a readmission agreement with Latvia to prevent illegal immigrants from Vietnam from trespassing Latvia's borders.
Representatives of the Foreign Ministry said that while attending a meeting of EU-ASEAN foreign ministers in Bangkok, Rinkevics met with Vietnam's Deputy Foreign Minister Nguyen Quoc Dung to discuss political and economic cooperation between the two countries.
Rinkevics called on Vietnamese authorities to speed up the conclusion of the readmission agreement with Latvia, saying that it is especially important to Latvia, given that Vietnamese citizens have been illegally arriving in Latvia in large numbers in recent years.
From our perspective, the sectors such as timber industry, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, heavy engineering and electronics are the most promising," Rinkevis said, also noting potential for advancing cooperation with Vietnam in the educational sector through preparing an agreement on cooperation in education and the recognition of higher education qualifications.
As reported, several groups of illegal immigrants have been held for trespassing Latvia's border this year, including several hundred Vietnamese citizens and dozens of their traffickers.

We must await the results of the investigations. We do n't want to hurt the Russians.
Iraq summons Turkish ambassador to protest troop presence Baghdad, Oct 13, 2016 (AFP) - The Iraqi foreign ministry summoned the Turkish ambassador on Thursday to protest the continued presence of Turkish troops in northern Iraq without Baghdad's permission, a ministry spokesman said.
Turkish troops are deployed in the Bashiqa area near the jihadist-held city of Mosul, and Turkey's prime minister has said that they will stay despite Baghdad's demands that they be withdrawn.
Abadi has repeatedly demanded that the Turkish troops be withdrawn and said that they will not take part in the impending operation to recapture Mosul from the Islamic State jihadist group.
The US State Department issued a statement earlier this week that implicitly backed Iraq's position, saying that: "We believe all international forces in Iraq should be there with the approval of and in coordination with the government of Iraq ."
More than 7,000 military personnel from a US-led coalition are deployed in Iraq to support Baghdad's forces, but the coalition has repeatedly stated that the Turkish deployment is not part of its operations.
Social Democrat Kern has kept other countries guessing on whether Austria will give its approval for the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) which many see as a blueprint for TTIP, an EU trade deal with the United States.
Kern reiterated in an ORF radio interview that his decision on whether to support CETA would depend to a large extent on a ruling by the German constitutional court on the accord expected on Thursday.
When asked whether a positive ruling would automatically remove pressure on an additional declaration which he had pushed for, Kern said :" The additional text attempts to improve detailed regulation beyond (the ruling), which has been successful to a large degree already ."
In addition to uncertainty about Austria's vote on CETA, Southern Belgium is set to block the deal, while backing from Slovenia remains uncertain.

Sobotka, of the right-wing Austrian People's Party, also called on EU members to speed up the deportations of people whose asylum applications have been rejected.
"The expansion of Frontex is a first step in the right direction, but more must follow it in order to be able to protect the EU's external borders," Sobotka told Die Welt, referring to the European Union's patrols of the Mediterranean Sea.
"We have a paradoxical situation here in that people ineligible for asylum can not be deported back to their countries of origin," he said.
A full agenda Sobotka gave the interview to Die Welt ahead of Thursday's EU interior ministers' meeting in Luxembourg.
He told the German newspaper that people would not stop coming if the European Union continued to allow them to apply for asylum after "rescuing" them from boats on the Mediterranean Sea.
Critics say Greece has too few "hot spots," where displaced people are registered and accommodated while decisions on their eligibility for asylum are made.

Polish conservatives pursue abortion ban despite mass protests Warsaw, Oct 12, 2016 (AFP) - The leader of Poland's governing right-wing party said Wednesday he still hopes to tighten the country's abortion laws, despite parliament's recent rejection of a proposed ban on terminations in the devoutly Catholic nation.
"We will strive to ensure that even difficult pregnancies -- when the child is sure to die, severely deformed -- will result in birth so that the child can be baptised, buried, and have a name," Law and Justice (PiS) party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski told the Polish news agency PAP.
"Currently there are around 1,000 legal abortions in Poland, a huge number of which is due to Down syndrome," Kaczynski said.
"We hope that this will not be the case soon.
We have to prepare it well though. We also have to convince society, especially women, and we will do it ."
Kaczynski added however that "of course this refers only to those cases of difficult pregnancy when there is no threat to the life and health of the mother ."

Entrepreneurs representing the trade and manufacturing sectors also pointed to possible negative effects (22 percent in both sectors).
Representatives of exporting companies were mostly concerned about Brexit's consequences (35 percent), while 4 percent of exporters expected Brexint to bring about positive changes.

Social partners praise improvement of communication with government, criticize decisions in relation to budget RIGA, Oct 13 (LETA) - Social partners at the Latvian National Tripartite Cooperation Council meeting today praised the government for improving communication, but also criticized many decisions in relation to next year's budget.
Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis (Greens/Farmers) when opening the meeting commended the fact that the government and social partners had respected each other and have tried to look for compromises.
"We are hearing that the budget is not for development, that it is not as it had been planned and hoped.
But we have found solutions, even though they might seem unpopular to someone," the prime minister said.
For example, there are reports about reduced teachers wages after the wage reform, but it should be understood that the wage can not remain the same for teaching three or 30 pupils.
Egils Baldzens, the deputy chairman of the Latvian Confederation of Free Trade Unions (LBAS), also praised improvement of the social dialogue, but he said that this does not refer to all ministries as there are some complicated examples.
At the same time, the organization believes that wage growth is still insufficient.
Baldzens spoke positively about the launched reforms in the health care system, but said that the issue of increase of medics wages has been neglected.
Janis Endzins, the chairman of the Latvian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that cooperation with the incumbent government has been better than with any of the previous governments.
"It has been said that there will be no micro enterprises, but everything else is still much unclear," said Endzins.
If the current regulations remain into force, people will either move into shadow economy or leave jobs and this might start protests, said Endzins.
Martins Bicevskis, the head of the Latvian Association of Commercial Banks, voiced concerns about the tax policy and business environment, but he wished the government the ability and endurance to continue the started reforms.
Valdis Keris, the chairman of the Latvian Health and Social Care Workers' Trade Union (LVSADA), underscored that the budget does not solve important issues in relation to the health care sector.

Germany proposes N. Africa centres for rescued migrants Luxembourg, Oct 13, 2016 (AFP) - Migrants rescued at sea should be taken to centres in north Africa where their claims for asylum in European Union countries can be studied, German interior minister Thomas de Maiziere proposed Thursday.
"People who are rescued in the Mediterranean should be brought back to safe accommodation facilities in northern Africa," de Maiziere told reporters.
"Their need for protection would be verified and we would put into place a resettlement to Europe with generous quotas, fairly divided between the European countries," the minister said.
De Maiziere did not mention a specific country in north Africa but EU officials have been discussing efforts to curb the migrant flow with Libya, the main transit point for African migrants heading to Europe.
Elina Pinto, a representative of the European Latvian Association (ELA), said that the plan to deny government-paid health care to Latvians living in foreign countries, which would come into effect in 2018, was understandable, given the needs of Latvia's tight budget.
"An excessively strict regulation should not effectively deny medical care to those Latvian citizens who do not work in foreign countries, but who study, look for work there or are unprotected in other ways.
Special attention should be given to children.
They can not pay taxes yet, but they can become our future physicians and medical nurses in Latvia," the ELA representative said.
The ELA representatives argued that those expatriates who do not pay their taxes in Latvia are still providing a considerable contribution to their native country's health care system by paying the full price for the medical services they receive while visiting Latvia, paying their retired relatives' medical bills and buying them medicines in Latvia.
"A substantial portion of the more than half a billion euro that the diaspora transfers to Latvia each year is spent on these purposes," Pinto said.
REUTERS/Stefanie Loos By Caroline Copley | BERLIN Germany's Constitutional Court gave the green light on Thursday for the government to approve an ambitious trade accord between the European Union and Canada under certain conditions, boosting its chances of going through in a vote next week.
However, it said the government must ensure that only parts of CETA which fall within the competence of the European Union, such as the removal of tariffs, should be allowed to apply provisionally.
This means that the controversial system of investor protection may only come into force following ratification by national parliaments.
In addition, it must be possible for Germany to unilaterally terminate the provisional application of the accord, said Andreas Vosskuhle, president of the court.
Brussels and Ottawa then hope to sign the accord on Oct. 27. The European Parliament would also need to vote to allow parts of it to go into force.
Michael Jackson outstrips Prince, Bowie as top-earning dead celebrity Michael Jackson topped an annual list of the top-earning dead celebrities on Wednesday for the fourth straight year, far outstripping fellow musical icons Prince and David Bowie who passed away earlier this year.
Jackson, who died in 2009, raked in a bumper $825 million in earnings for the 12 months ending Oct. 1, according to estimates from Forbes.
That came mostly from the Jackson estate's $750 million sale of the late singer's remaining stake in the Sony/ATV music publishing catalog - which includes the rights to many Beatles songs - to Sony Corp.
Sales of Prince albums soared after the musician died of an accidental drug overdose in April.
Forbes' estimates were based on pretax income, before management and legal expenses, and were compiled through interviews with estate experts and data on record sales, touring, and movie earnings.

Dutch may allow assisted suicide for those who feel life is over AMSTERDAM The Dutch government intends to draft a law that would legalize assisted suicide for people who feel they have "completed life," but are not necessarily terminally ill, it said on Wednesday.
The Netherlands was the first country to legalize euthanasia, in 2002, but only for patients who were considered to be suffering unbearable pain with no hope of a cure.
In a letter to parliament, the health and justice ministers said details remain to be worked out but that people who "have a well-considered opinion that their life is complete, must, under strict and careful criteria, be allowed to finish that life in a manner dignified for them ."
Euthanasia accounted for 5,516 deaths in the Netherlands in 2015, or 3.9 percent of all deaths nationwide.
Health Minister Edith Schippers wrote in the letter that "because the wish for a self-chosen end of life primarily occurs in the elderly, the new system will be limited to" them.
They hope to draft a law, in consultation with doctors, ethicists and other experts, by the end of 2017.

He also said he did not know anything about Berzins' role in the alleged affair.
According to TV3, the fourth person detained in the case is Blaizer-AG board chairman Anri Kursitis.
According to information available on the Corruption Prevention Bureau's website, Krumins two years ago donated EUR 15,000 to the Union of Greens and Farmers, and in 2011 and in 2004 he donated several thousands of euros to Zatlers Reform Party and Latvia's Way.

Syrian bomb plotter commits suicide in German police custody-Spiegel A Syrian migrant suspected of planning a bomb attack on a Berlin airport has committed suicide in policy custody, Spiegel Online reported on Wednesday, citing judicial sources.
The news website said Jaber Albakr had been under round-the-clock surveillance due to an acute risk of suicide and hunger strike. It was not yet clear how he had killed himself, Spiegel said.
The trove contains songs like Rebirth of the Flesh, Electric Intercourse and Extraloveable - which have been widely bootlegged, but never formally issued. It also contains hundreds of hours of live recordings and concert footage.
Quoting an unnamed source, the magazine said a deluxe edition of Purple Rain - which was announced in 2014 but never materialised - was now likely to be released in 2017. A new greatest hits compilation is also due before the end of the year.
The late singer was the only person with the code to open the safe.
'Comical songs' According to the singer's former recording engineer Susan Rodgers, who started the vault for Prince during the 1980s, the facility was almost full when she left in 1987, with songs in there that pre-date his legendary Purple Rain album.
However, the ownership of the music is unclear. Much of the material was recorded when Prince was under contract to Warner Bros, and he subsequently signed one-off deals with every other major label, several independents and Jay-Z's Tidal streaming service.
The musician died from an overdose of the painkiller fentanyl in April without leaving a will.
A tribute concert to the star will take place in St Paul, Minnesota, on Thursday, featuring performances from Stevie Wonder, Christina Aguilera, Chaka Khan, Tori Kelly and Prince's first wife Mayte Garcia, among others.

"All of this was of a tremendous importance at the time of oppression," he added.
"People would not have known what was going on.
I think that we owe much to samizdat.
This is naturally true not only of Czechs, but also of Slovaks, Poles and other nations that lived in oppression," he added.

They want to spread the declaration to Poland and Russia through their past dissident contacts, he added.

"Well, from the European Commission point of view we are now emphasising that the ball now is in UK court.
"But staying within the internal market comes with a number of conditions.
If UK is ready to respect those conditions, certainly there's a possibility to discuss the so-called soft Brexit," he said, speaking in English.
"( What) President Tusk was probably referring to is more or less the statement which comes from UK government itself, which seems to be indicating rather towards a so-called hard Brexit ."
He said in a speech Thursday: "I think it is useless to speculate about'soft Brexit '.
"In my opinion, the only real alternative to a'hard Brexit 'is'no Brexit'.

Syria's Assad says taking Aleppo from rebels key to pushing'terrorists' back to Turkey Syria's President Bashar al-Assad said on Friday that the Syrian army's capture of Aleppo, which has come under renewed bombardment in an effort to seize its rebel-held sector, would be "a very important springboard" to pushing "terrorists" back to Turkey.
"You have to keep cleaning this area and to push the terrorists to Turkey, to go back to where they come from or to kill them.
"Aleppo is going to be a very important springboard to do this move," added Assad.
As the air strikes and shelling of the city's east intensified after a brief period of relative calm, Syria's government approved a United Nations plan to allow aid convoys into the most besieged areas of Syria, with the exception of Aleppo.
Assad also told the newspaper that the country's civil war had become a conflict between Russia and the West.

The Foreign Ministry's Parliamentary Secretary Zanda Kalnina-Lukasevica (Unity) points out that the CETA agreement is not only important economically, but also geo-politically, as Canada is an important partner country for Latvia and the EU.
The agreement -- signed between Moscow and Damascus in August 2015 -- allowed Russia to establish its Hmeimim airbase to launch operations in support of ally President Bashar al-Assad's forces.
Putin's official signing off on the pact, that lasts for an "indefinite" period, is a legal move that many believe will now pave the way for Moscow to make the base permanent.
Putin in August asked lawmakers to ratify the deal, which grants Russian forces immunity from prosecution in Syria.
As relations have slumped, the Kremlin has bolstered its forces in Syria and on Monday announced they will also turn their Soviet-era naval facility in the country into a permanent base.

US finds growing evidence Russia feeding emails to WikiLeaks Washington (CNN) There is mounting evidence that the Russian government is supplying WikiLeaks with hacked emails pertaining to the US presidential election, US officials familiar with the investigation have told CNN.
"The kinds of disclosures that we've seen, including at WikiLeaks, of stolen e-mails from people who play an important role in our political process is consistent with Russian- directed efforts," White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday.
"It is now clear that the illegal hack of my personal email account was -- just like the other recent, election-related hacks -- the work of the Russian government," Podesta said in a statement.
"This level of meddling by a foreign power can only be aimed at boosting Donald Trump and should send chills down the spine of all Americans, regardless of political party ."

Rowling to conjure five'Fantastic Beasts' films for Potter fans" Harry Potter" fans got fantastic news on Thursday.
Author J.K. Rowling said that the Potter spinoff movie franchise "Fantastic Beasts" will consist of five films, up from the previously announced three.
"We set a trilogy as a placeholder because we knew there would be more than one movie, but... we're pretty sure it's going to be five movies," Rowling told participants in London gathered at a fan event.
The British author of the best-selling "Harry Potter" books was a surprise addition at a question-and-answer event with the "Fantastic Beasts" cast in London and Los Angeles that was broadcast across the world.
"We're talking about the first time a wizard rose and threatened the world order.
Fans at the event were shown the first 10 minutes of "Fantastic Beasts," which opens on Nov. 18.
"Fantastic Beasts" taps in to the eight-film Potter franchise that officially concluded with "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2" in 2011.
"The court rejects all the defence's objections," judge Hendrik Steenhuis told The Hague district court.
But in his ruling, Steenhuis said prosecuting Wilders will "not affect his political freedoms or that of his Freedom Party ."
When the crowd shouted back "Fewer!
His lawyers argued Wilders had merely "put forward his party's political programme", and insisted he had a fundamental right to freedom of speech.
Continuing with the case to trial could have "far reaching political consequences for democracy in the Netherlands," his lawyer had argued.

Commenting recent audit findings that risks were not properly evaluated and procurement documents were drawn up in haste in 2013, Matiss explained that, following the failed electric train procurement in 2013, the government decided to redistribute EU financing of LVL 100 million (EUR 142) million among several other projects, including modernization of diesel trains.
Had the government not done that, the EU funds would have been lost.
There may have been some mistakes due to haste, but it was largely a conceptual question, whether to implement the project or not, said Matiss.
Explaining the delays with train modernization, Matiss said that Rigas Vagonbuves Rupnica (Riga Railcar Factory), the company that did the largest share of the job, had not worked on such projects for a long time and had to quickly introduce new technologies.
At the same time, Matiss is happy that the project has been implemented by local companies, which will now be able to participate in procurements organized by other countries and preserve railcar construction and reconstruction traditions in Latvia.
As reported, Pasazieru Vilciens on September 19 received the last modernized diesel trains, thus, the project on upgrading 19 diesel trains co-financed by the EU Cohesion Fund completed.
Big donors urge Republican Party to drop Trump: NYT Washington, Oct 14, 2016 (AFP) - Some of the Republican Party's biggest financial donors urged its national committee on Thursday to drop Donald Trump in the wake of accusations he sexually assaulted women, The New York Times reported.
"At some point, you have to look in the mirror and recognize that you can not possibly justify support for Trump to your children -- especially your daughters," Missouri businessman David Humphreys told The New York Times, which said he contributed more than $2.5 million (2.3 million euros) in the last four years.
"He is a dangerous demagogue completely unsuited to the responsibilities of a United States president," New York investor Bruce Kovner said in an email to the daily.
"Even for loyalists, there is a line beyond which the obvious moral failings of a candidate are impossible to disregard," he wrote.
"That line has been clearly breached ."
"Reince should be fired and replaced with someone who has the competence and leadership skills to rebuild the RNC," California investor William Oberndorf told the paper.
However, the party's major donors have little leverage over a candidate who is relying largely on his own money and many small donations from his far-right electoral base.
Study: Russia has'playbook 'for covert influence in Eastern Europe WASHINGTON, Oct 13 (Reuters) - Russia has mounted a campaign of covert economic and political measures to manipulate five countries in central and eastern Europe, discredit the West's liberal democratic model, and undermine trans-Atlantic ties, a report by a private U.S. research group said.
"In certain countries, Russian influence has become so pervasive and endemic that it has challenged national stability as well as a country's Western orientation and Euro-Atlantic stability," said the report of a 16-month study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and the Sofia, Bulgaria-based Center for the Study of Democracy.
"The Russians have been engaged in a sustained campaign to recapture what Putin considers their rightful buffer in Eastern Europe, and to undermine not just NATO and the EU, but the entire democratic foundation of both institutions," said a U.S. official who has studied Russian behavior since before the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991. The official requested anonymity because, he said, the White House has ordered officials not to publicly discuss hostile Russian activities.
Those activities, he said, include bribery, propaganda, disinformation, "the occasional" assassination of Kremlin critics at home or abroad, and now using the internet to undermine opponents and weaken Western institutions.
Heather Conley, the former U.S. official and lead author of the report, said in an interview that the study was intended to highlight a challenge that has received insufficient attention from American and European policymakers.
"The first step is to acknowledge that which is happening," said Conley.
"What is at stake here is how we view ourselves and the functioning of our democracy ."
Obama enshrines Cuba normalization as official US policy Washington, Oct 14, 2016 (AFP) - US President Barack Obama on Friday announced a directive formalizing a policy of normalization with Cuba and unveiling a new round of loosened trade and travel rules.
"This new directive consolidates and builds upon the changes we've already made, promotes transparency by being clear about our policy and intentions, and encourages further engagement between our countries and our people," Obama said.
The move makes normalization now federal policy even though Congress has not lifted the fifty-year-old US trade embargo on Cuba, according to senior administration officials who spoke to reporters in a conference call.
The changes could be reversed when a new administration takes office, they said, speaking on grounds of anonymity, but presidential directives generally remain in effect until further notice.

The resolutions refer to "Occupied Palestine" and aim to "safeguard the Palestinian cultural heritage and the distinctive character of East Jerusalem", according to a text seen by AFP.

He confirmed that Italy was currently planning to deploy 150 soldiers to Latvia.
Soldiers will begin to arrive in Latvia next spring, and the deployment will be completed by early fall.
The other countries involved in setting up the battalion will decide themselves how many soldiers to send to Latvia.
In early September more than 150 experts from Canada, Spain, Slovenia, Italy and Poland met in Latvia to discuss logistical, operational and legal aspects of the battle group's deployment, as well as inspected Latvia's military infrastructure.
REUTERS/Martin Bureau/Pool Former Prime Minister Alain Juppe was seen as the winner of the first debate on Thursday among candidates for the center-right's nomination in France's 2017 presidential election, a poll published immediately afterward showed.
The debate showed great similarities among the seven candidates on economic proposals meant to reduce public spending and loosen or eliminate France's iconic 35-hour work week.
There were more differences on issues of security and immigration, with contenders quarrelling over whether those on intelligence services' watch lists should be systematically detained.
Sarkozy, who was France's president from 2007 to 2012 before losing to current president, Socialist Francois Hollande, was attacked by several of his former ministers and party allies.
"Ten years ago, in 2007, I believed in Nicolas Sarkozy's plan to break with the past, but it never happened," former conservative party leader Jean-Francois Cope said.
"If I had been put under formal investigation, I would n't have run (in this election)," he said.
Sarkozy, who denies any wrongdoing, retorted that such accusations "do not honor those who make them ."
All were harsh in their criticism of Hollande, the most unpopular French president on record and a likely opponent in the April 2017 presidential election.
Mission controllers will instruct a spacecraft about 175 million kilometres (109 million miles) from Earth to release and steer a paddling pool-sized lander towards the Red Planet's cold, dry surface.
"Our goal here is to prove we can get to the surface, do science, take data," European Space Agency (ESA) science advisor Mark McCaughrean said ahead of Sunday's lander-release manoeuvres.
The lander and the TGO -- which will enter into orbit around Mars to sniff its atmosphere for gases excreted by living organisms -- comprise the first phase of the joint European-Russian ExoMars project.
More than half of US, Russian and European attempts to land and operate craft on the Martian surface since the 1960s have failed.
The last time Europe tried, the British-built Beagle 2 disappeared without a trace after separating from the Mars Express mothership in December 2003. It was finally spotted in January 2015 in a NASA picture of Mars.
Statement about Latvia's "third most competitive tax system in OECD" not justified - LDDK RIGA, Oct 14 (LETA) - Statement that Latvia has the third most competitive tax system among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) members is beyond criticism, believes the Employers' Confederation of Latvia (LDDK).
Latvia is in third place in the corporate tax ranking, behind Estonia and New Zealand.
"In the research, that has attracted a lot of publicity in Latvia and ironic comments online, tax systems in OECD member countries are compared, but the research was not carried out by OECD," notes LDDK.
Therefore it has been agreed with the government to work toward a new, competitive and predictable tax policy, to achieve an increase in the number of taxpayers and volume of investments.
"By developing and introducing a really competitive tax system, Latvia wo n't have to be proud of results that were gained using rare methodologies, but our tax system will be highly appreciated in authoritative researches," insists LDDK.

Do n't put out garbage please!
It is believed that it contains thousands of hours of recorded music spanning the length of his 40-year career before his unexpected death in April 2016.
Owing to the conplicated series of contracts Prince had with different labels, there are likely to be significant disputes over who owns the right to certain pieces of music, depending on who he was signed to at the time of recording.
It has also been reported that the deluxe edition of Purple Rain, announced as part of the artist’s 2014 Warner Bros deal, could be released in early 2017, along with a new greatest hits compilation later this year.
Health care workers union's head does not exclude possibility of more protests RIGA, Oct 14 (LETA) - The head of the Latvian Health and Social Care Workers' Trade Union (LVSADA) Valdis Keris does not exclude the possibility of more protests when the parliament reviews next year’s budget.
At 12 noon today, the trade union handed in to Saeima a petition with more than 8000 signatures demanding that financing for health care be increased.
The petition has been signed by almost 10,000 people, which is a serious signal to politicians that, in case they treat health care the same way as usual, people will not vote for them in the next election, said Keris.
The trade union is ready to explain to Saeima the essence of international organizations' recommendation to increase financing for health care.
The other parties have not done that yet.
As reported, today LVSADA held a protest by the Ministry of Finance, which was attended by approximately 60 people.
The goal of the rally is to raise the public’s attention that next year’s budget does not comply with international organizations' recommendations for urgent and essential improvements in access to healthcare in Latvia.
Erdogan's fresh legal complaint against German satirist thrown out Koblenz, Germany (dpa) - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's fresh legal complaint against a German satirist who ridiculed him in a poem has been unsuccessful, with the attorney general's office calling the action unfounded in a statement on Friday.
Prosecutors in the western German city of Mainz dropped an investigation into Jan Boehmermann for insulting Erdogan earlier this month in a case that has raised tensions between Ankara and Berlin. The Turkish head of state then lodged a fresh complaint against Boehmermann over the crude poem he recited on broadcaster ZDF in March, in which he said Erdogan watched child pornography and performed sex acts with animals.
The initial investigation was carried out under Germany's defamation law and a little-used statute against insulting foreign heads of state, prompting a heated debate about the limits of free speech in Germany.

Pamela, who is currently visiting London, posted the letter to the Prime Minister on Wednesday (12Oct16), calling on her to bring forward a ban.

The Committee to Protect Journalists said its board passed a resolution "declaring Trump an unprecedented threat to the rights of journalists and to CPJ's ability to advocate for press freedom around the world ."
"Through his words and actions, Trump has consistently demonstrated a contempt for the role of the press beyond offering publicity to him and advancing his interests ."
Rowe said that any weakening of press freedom in the United States would have "far more serious" consequences for journalists elsewhere.
"Any failure of the United States to uphold its own standards emboldens dictators and despots to restrict the media in their own countries," she said.
"This appears to be of no concern to Trump, who indicated that he has no inclination to challenge governments on press freedom and the treatment of journalists ."
Trump's skirmishes with the media have intensified amid revelations over his apparent failure to pay taxes, and more recently, accounts claiming he sexually assaulted several women.
But the Middlesbrough boxer insists he will cause an upset which would propel him onto the world stage in his clash of unbeaten cruiserweights against the WBC mandatory challenger from Latvia.

“I’m in the best condition of my life physically and mentally - I’m sharp, I’m fit and I’m ready for every scenario.
“When I win it will open the doors that I want to be open.” Vallily won an ABA title and Commonwealth Games and GB Championship gold medals in the amateurs, but the Briedis bout represents a quantum leap in levels in the professional code.
“I want to be the best, and to do that you’ve got to beat the best.
“But I always had faith that fights like this would come and I didn’t hesitate to accept it when I got told it could be made.

Football: FIFA to decide on World Cup reform in January Zurich, Oct 13, 2016 (AFP) - FIFA executives will make a final decision on World Cup reform in January after weighing up three proposals on Thursday, as president Gianni Infantino pushes plans to grow the lucrative tournament.
One option studied by the powerful FIFA Council at Thursday's meeting was a 40-team World Cup, with eight groups of five teams, or 10 groups of four.
"We'll keep an open mind and an open spirit and maybe we do n't change anything and maybe we change everything," Infantino said after the first of the two-day council meeting.
"The decision will be taken at the next council meeting in January," he said.
Russia unveils first-ever monument to Ivan the Terrible Moscow, Oct 14, 2016 (AFP) - Russia on Friday inaugurated a controversial monument to Ivan the Terrible, a 16th-century tyrant whose rehabilitation has been lobbied for by officials despite protests from historians and the local community.
Tsar Ivan IV Vasilyevich ruled Russia from 1547 to 1584 and earned the moniker "Terrible" due to his brutal policy of oprichnina, which included the creation of a secret police that spread mass terror and executed thousands of people.
The governor of Russia's Oryol region, some 335 kilometres (200 miles) south of Moscow, has nonetheless backed the first-ever monument to the tsar, saying during its inauguration Friday that Ivan the Terrible "was a defender of our land, a tsar who expanded its frontiers ."
The monument was also backed by Russia's culture minister, who has argued that Ivan the Terrible's brutal rule is a myth and that his name was tarnished by Western travellers who libelled him in their writings.
Some Oryol activists staged protests against the monument over several months and even filed lawsuits against city hall's decision to erect it.
REFILE; Ten killed in South Korean tour bus fire Seoul (dpa) - Ten people were killed and seven injured late Thursday when a tourist bus crashed and caught fire on an expressway in South Korea, police said.

Turkey sacks or suspends hundreds more judges in coup probe The Turkish Armed Forces sacked 109 military judges on Thursday, the defense ministry said, further extending a crackdown which has targeted tens of thousands of state employees as authorities investigate an attempted coup in July.
Gulen denies any involvement in the failed coup.
In total, some 32,000 people have been jailed pending trial and 100,000 members of the security and civil services, teachers and others have been fired or suspended from work.
On Wednesday, Turkish authorities issued arrest warrants for 215 more police officers, and the defense ministry said the armed forces had dismissed more than 200 personnel.
The purges within the armed forces, NATO's second largest, have resulted in thousands of soldiers being discharged, and around 40 percent of generals.
Erdogan vowed to restructure the military after the coup. The coastguard command was brought under interior ministry control and its head was dismissed.
In its notice, the coastguard command said it would hire 50 officers, 105 sergeants, and 605 privates under contracts, and announced applicants must have no links to any "terrorist organization or its legal and illegal extensions".

The Great Wall was built more than a millennium ago to keep invading foreigners away from China's capital.
Britain to present UN resolution demanding Yemen ceasefire United Nations, United States, Oct 14, 2016 (AFP) - Britain will present a draft resolution to the United Nations Security Council demanding an immediate ceasefire in Yemen following the deadly air strike on a funeral ceremony, the British ambassador said Friday.
"We have decided to put forward a draft Security Council resolution on Yemen calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities and a resumption of the political process," British Ambassador Matthew Rycroft told reporters.
The decision to seek a formal resolution came after Russia blocked a statement drafted by Britain that condemned the air strike, apparently carried out by the Saudi-led coalition, that killed more than 140 mourners.
Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said the statement was "wishy-washy," and called for "some very serious thinking" on how to address the deteriorating situation in Yemen.
Dozens of people watched as the official, a member of Turkey's parliamentary delegation to the Council, removed the image from the mural titled "The Road not Taken" on Wednesday, the source said.
The work on the theme of freedom of expression, titled "The Road not Taken", is made up of around 1,000 images.
The mural's Maltese creator Norbert Attard told the online version of The Malta Independent he had placed the "censored" banner across the cartoon "so that it would not offend anyone".
The incident occurred as Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was in Strasbourg to address the Council of Europe and open an exhibition on the attempted coup in his country in July.
At the meeting, the parties made note of an increase in the intensity of political dialogue and the exchange of high-level visits, and expressed mutual interest in continued political consultations on a regular basis.
Food industry, transport and logistics, and tourism were identified as sectors with the highest potential for cooperation.
The parties welcomed an agreement achieved this year on veterinary certificates for dairy products, beef, mutton, goat meat and products thereof.
The expansion of legal framework also has a major role to play in the deepening of bilateral relations.
The first UAE Ambassador-in-residence is soon coming on her accreditation visit to Latvia.
The consultations also focused on regional issues, in particular, the Syrian conflict, the crisis in Libya, the fight against terrorism, and the Middle East peace process.
Bob Dylan makes no mention of Nobel prize as he takes to the stage The Guardian The Chelsea theatre in Las Vegas sees the master songwriter gives his first concert since winning the Nobel accolade Newly-minted Nobel laureate Bob Dylan kept cool as a cucumber on stage in Las Vegas, barely speaking a word to the audience in his first public performance since winning the coveted prize.
As the audience chanted for more songs on Thursday night, Dylan gave just a brief encore, ending his set with a mournful yet playful cover of Frank Sinatra’s Why Try To Change Me Now.
He is the first musician ever to win the Nobel Prize in literature, and the first American to pick up the prize since novelist Toni Morrison, author of the novels Jazz, Song of Solomon, and Beloved, who won in 1993.
Others to receive the prize include Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Pablo Neruda, Saul Bellow, Samuel Beckett and John Steinbeck. Not everyone welcomed the move.
Stafford, a writer of prose, said that it was “high time” a singer/songwriter won the Nobel prize for literature.
Pabriks hopes Belgian PM will take necessary action in wake of today's negative vote of CETA by regional parliament RIGA, Oct 14 (LETA) - European Parliament Member Artis Pabriks (Unity) hopes that Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel will take the necessary action in wake of today's negative vote on the EU-Canada free-trade agreement (CETA) taken by the regional parliament of Wallonia, he told LETA.
Pabriks, who is the responsible MEP in the European Parliament for CETA, believes that the vote by the parliament of Wallonia is politically motivated.
''This just once again shows how unstable countries with such political systems are, where one small portion of society can block an initiative seven years in the making, which is dependent on millions of residents," he said.
''This is a paradox.
The ball is now in the court of the Belgian prime minister, as this is an internal political struggle.
This is not about the agreement, but the domestic political situation in Belgium.
At the same time, Pabriks said that this serves as a lesson not only to voters, but also to the European Commission and Council, as initially the decision on CETA was in the hands of the European Parliament.
''However, it was submitted to national parliaments for review, which makes this whole process much harder," he added.
"I will not give powers to the federal government, and Belgium will not sign CETA on October 18," Paul Magnette, the socialist head of the Wallonia government, told an emergency session of the regional parliament.

Santiago said a warrant for Coolio's arrest would be issued if he failed to appear for the later court date.
The rapper's lawyer, Michael Aisen, declined to comment on the case.
Coolio, a Los Angeles-area native, is perhaps best known for his 1995 Grammy Award-winning hit "Gangsta's Paradise," the No. 1 U.S. chart-topper that year and one of the best-selling singles of all time.
Prosecutors said the case remains under investigation by police.
Israel slams UNESCO over'Occupied Jerusalem' Jerusalem, Oct 13, 2016 (AFP) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blasted UNESCO for holding a vote Thursday on "Occupied Palestine" saying the Paris-based UN cultural body has lost its legitimacy.
The resolutions refer to "Occupied Palestine" and aim to "safeguard the Palestinian cultural heritage and the distinctive character of East Jerusalem", according to a text seen by AFP.
"With this absurd decision, UNESCO has lost what legitimacy it once had," Netanyahu said in a statement.
"We are deeply concerned about these kinds of recurring politicized resolutions that do nothing to advance constructive results on the ground and we do n't believe they should be adopted," State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner said.
The status of Jerusalem is the thorniest issue of the decades-long Palestinian conflict.
Israel captured east Jerusalem during the 1967 war and later annexed it -- in a move not recognised by the international community -- declaring all of the city its unified capital. The Palestinians see east Jerusalem as the capital of their promised future state.

Ex-Catalan chief to stand trial for independence vote Barcelona, Oct 13, 2016 (AFP) - Catalonia's former separatist chief Artur Mas will stand trial for staging a symbolic independence vote, judicial authorities said Thursday, just weeks after the Spanish region's current president promised a referendum.
In his court order, the investigating magistrate said Mas would take the stand on charges of "serious disobedience" and "malfeasance" for allowing the non-binding ballot to take place in November 2014 in the wealthy, northeastern region.
Mas had initially wanted to organise an independence referendum like the one held in Scotland, but the Spanish government went to court to block his plans.
Prosecutors, though, argue that they "created a strategy of complete and effective defiance of the (vote) suspension decided by the Constitutional Court ."
He hopes to hold the vote with the agreement of Madrid, but has said he will press ahead anyway if the central government refuses.

Gróbarczyk said the geopolitical aspect of the project “is extremely important” to Poland.
“It is impermissible for an eastern border of the EU and a NATO border to be 100 percent under Russian control, for security to be threatened that way.
This is the main argument we will put to the EU and which will be met with full understanding.” Construction plans for the five-metre-deep, 1.3 km-long canal were approved by the Polish government in May.

Runoff vote to determine Czech govt majority's strength in Senate Prague, Oct 13 (ÈTK) - The Czech Senate election's runoff vote this weekend will decide on how strong the government's majority will be in the upper house of parliament, but it will change nothing about the Social Democrat (CSSD) senators' group being the strongest of all.
the CSSD, ANO and the Christian Democrats (KDU-CSL), face each other in the runoff.
To gain the constitutional majority of 49 seats, they need to win in at least seven of the wards where they face non-government candidates.
However, such achievement would have only a symbolic effect in a situation where the government does not have a constitutional majority in the Chamber Deputies, the lower house of parliament.
However, all its successful candidates beat their respective rivals only narrowly, with the exception of the candidate in the Olomouc ward.
In many other wards, there is no clear favourite and the runoff result in them is hard to predict.
In the runoff vote, turnout is usually up to 50 percent lower than in the first round.
The elections in the 27 wards involve 2.78 million voters. One third of them took part in the first round, which was held simultaneously with the elections to regional assemblies last weekend.

"In the second half our opponents were better than us.
Toulouse are a good team with quality players," said Monaco coach Leonardo Jardim, whose team travel to CSKA Moscow in the Champions League on Tuesday.
Ozil then appeared to end their hopes early in the second half before Arsenal were left to unexpectedly hold on after Borja Baston scored a second Swansea goal Xhaka was then harshly red-carded for a foul on Modou Barrow. Bradley, the first American manager in the Premier League, suffered a difficult afternoon as his new side ended the day in the relegation zone.
Arsene Wenger's side enjoyed most of the possession but Swansea occasionally threatened on the break, Leroy Fer shooting just over from the edge of the area following Kyle Naughton's cross.
Swansea though were given a lifeline as the hosts caught the poor defending bug, Xhaka inexplicably robbed in possession before Sigurdsson fired home from the edge of the area in the 38th minute.
Sanchez picked out Ozil in expert fashion in the 57th minute and the German celebrated his 28th birthday with a powerful volley from close range.
Walcott then hit the bar with virtually the last kick following Oxlade-Chamberlain's pass on another counter-attack. str/jdg/nr

Syria talks in Lausanne end without breakthrough Syria talks convened by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in the Swiss city of Lausanne on Saturday evening failed to agree on a common strategy with Russia to end the conflict in Syria, now in its sixth year.
Kerry hosted Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and seven foreign ministers from the region - from Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, Jordan and Egypt - weeks after the collapse of a painstakingly crafted U.S.-Russian ceasefire plan that many saw as the last hope for peace this year.
But the meeting failed to come up with a joint statement or a shared vision on how to move forward.
Lavrov, who had said he had "no special expectations" for Saturday's meeting, said ministers had discussed several "interesting ideas", without elaborating.
Europe was not represented at the meeting, held in a luxury hotel on Lake Geneva. But France's Foreign Ministry confirmed that Kerry and foreign ministers of like-minded nations planned to meet in London on Sunday to discuss Syria.
Witnesses told police gunfire was exchanged between a gray Dodge Charger and a dark-colored sports car with tinted windows.
Authorities found the Dodge and detained two people for questioning as they continue to search for the other vehicle.

UK's Labour Party not doing enough on anti-Semitism: lawmakers Britain's opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has not done enough to stamp out anti-Jewish sentiment in his party, a prominent parliamentary committee said on Sunday.
"The failure of the Labour Party to deal consistently and effectively with anti-Semitic incidents in recent years risks lending force to allegations that elements of the Labour movement are institutionally anti-Semitic," the report said.
"The result is that the Labour Party, with its proud history of fighting racism and promoting equal rights, is seen by some as an unwelcoming place for Jewish members and activists ."
In a lengthy response, Corbyn said the lawmakers had ignored anti-Semitism in other parties, had heard evidence from too narrow a pool of opinion and had criticized individuals without giving them a right to be heard.
The party suspended several people, including one of its lawmakers and former London mayor Ken Livingstone.
Emil Forsberg scored the only goal of the game, curling home unchallenged from just outside the box with 20 minutes remaining.
"We will have to talk about it in the club, what we want to do in the future, how we the see the possibility of playing better football again," sport director Klaus Allofs told Sky television.

"In the second half we have improved minute by minute and were rewarded with the goal," said Leipzig coach Ralph Hasenhuettl.
Wolfsburg are scrambling at the wrong end of the table and looking listless. Hecking said "things would be realistically analysed" while Allofs insisted calm would prevail.

Moscow announces 8-hour Aleppo ceasefire Moscow, Oct 17, 2016 (AFP) - Russia said Monday its forces and Syrian regime troops would briefly halt fire in Aleppo on Thursday, as criticism mounted of the ferocious Moscow-backed assault on the Syrian city.
"We have taken a decision not to waste time and to introduce'humanitarian pauses', mainly for the free passage of civilians, evacuation of the sick and wounded and withdrawal of fighters," senior Russian military officer Sergei Rudskoi said at a press briefing.
The ceasefire would run from 0800 to 1600 local time (0500 GMT to 1300 GMT) "in the area of Aleppo", Rudskoi said.
The European Union blasted Russia for causing "untold suffering" and said that air strikes by Moscow and Damascus in Aleppo "may amount to war crimes".

Japan mulls joint administration of disputed Russian-held isles: Nikkei Japan is considering proposing joint administration of disputed islands held by Russia in the hope of unblocking an issue that has bedevilled their relations for 70 years, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Monday.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe hopes to convince Russian President Vladimir Putin when they meet on Dec. 15 in Japan to begin negotiations on the proposal, the financial daily said, citing unnamed Japanese and Russian government sources.

Scientists hope that the manifesto will help the government realize how scientific innovations reach businessmen and contribute to the economic growth of the country, Latvian Academy of Sciences President Ojars Sparitis emphasized in an interview with the LNT television this morning.
At the moment, few politicians understand that scientists can help businessmen create new products and generate profits in the future, said Sparitis.
In addition, none of the coalition parties have engaged in a meaningful dialog with scientists, while the Education and Science Ministry and Ministry of Economics have not been doing enough, added Sparitis.
Leonardo DiCaprio Urged to Step Down From UN Climate Change Role The Hollywood reporter A rainforest charity calls on the star to denounce his connection to individuals involved in a Malaysian corruption scandal and return laundered money he allegedly received or give up his role.
"If DiCaprio is unwilling to come clean, we ask him to step down as UN Messenger for Peace for climate change, because he simply lacks the credibility for such an important role," said Lukas Straumann, director of the Switzerland-based charity, which has a particular focus on deforestation in Malaysia.
Leonardo DiCaprio, the Malaysian Money Scandal and His "Unusual" Foundation At the press conference, entitled "Recovery of Stolen Malaysian Assets," a direct link was made between the 1MDB corruption scandal and major environmental issues in Malaysia, such as deforestation, one of the main concerns of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation.
DiCaprio had been invited to talk at the press conference via an open letter from the Bruno Manser Funds, but did n't respond.
"We ca n't save the environment if we fail to stop corruption," said Straumann, who called DiCaprio's criticism of deforestation in Indonesia, just across a piece of water called the Malacca Strait from Malaysia, "cynical hypocrisy ."
Bosnian Serb elected Srebrenica mayor: official results Sarajevo, Oct 17, 2016 (AFP) - A Bosnian Serb has been elected mayor of Srebrenica, where thousands of Muslims were killed by the Bosnian Serb army during the 1990s war, official results showed Monday.
Mladen Grujicic will be the first Serbian mayor of the eastern Bosnian town since 1999 after winning 54.4 percent of votes in local elections on October 2.
The July 1995 massacre of some 8,000 Muslim men and boys from Srebrenica, a UN-protected enclave at the time, was Europe's worst atrocity since World War II and determined by two international courts to be genocide.
Unlike many European countries where abdication of kings and queens are relatively common, Japan's modern imperial law does n't allow abdication, and Japan's postwar Constitution stipulates the emperor as mere "symbol" with no political power or a say.
Allowing Akihito to abdicate would be a major change to the system, and raises a series of legal and logistical questions, ranging from laws subject to change to the emperor's post-abdication role, his title and residence.
His message was subtle and the Emperor did not use the word "abdication," because saying that openly could have violated his Constitutional status.
The government reportedly wants to allow Akihito's abdication as an exception and enact a special law to avoid dealing with divisive issues such as possible female succession and lack of successors.
The paper cited unidentified Japanese and Russian government sources.
"We deny the Nikkei report that Japan and Russia are discussing the joint administration of the Northern Territories," Japanese foreign ministry spokesman Yasuhira Kawamura told Reuters in an email, referring to the islands off Hokkaido known in Russia as the Southern Kuriles.
A Japanese ruling party source told Reuters that a proposal such as that reported by Nikkei was not very realistic.
The newspaper said Tokyo hoped to negotiate a return of the two smaller islands while adopting joint control of two larger islands.
Japan's position has been to assert its sovereignty over all of the disputed islands, but Russia regularly cites a 1956 joint declaration, never put into effect, that stipulates the return of the two smaller isles to Japan.

Business community has nothing to worry about concerning 2017 budget - Kucinskis RIGA, Oct 17 (LETA) - Of all taxes in Latvia, business community could only be concerned about the so-called solidarity tax, Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis (Greens/Farmers) said in an interview with Latvian Radio today while commenting the 2017 state budget.

Credit institutions obliged to react to information about new money laundering cases reported by mass media RIGA, Oct 17 (LETA) - Credit institutions will have to take relevant action every time the media report about new money laundering cases, according to the Finance Ministry's amendments to the Regulation on Unusual Transaction Indicator List and Procedure for Reporting Unusual and Suspicious Transactions, which the government's committee approved today.
The new requirement was originally planned to come into force on January 1 next year, however, the government committee decided that the day the amendments come into force would be specified yet.
The Finance Ministry earlier explained that the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development listed a number of shortcomings in its recommendations for Latvia concerning prevention of money laundering. One such problem is the fact that credit institutions did not report the Office for Prevention Laundering of Proceeds Derived from Criminal Activity about money laundering cases that the mass media had written about.

Organisers of the world's largest publishing event say the focus on art and technology is a logical next step as the creative industries become ever more connected.
The fair, which opens on Wednesday and is expected to draw some 275,000 visitors, has always been about "content -- regardless of its format", the event's vice-president Holger Volland told AFP.

Syria security chief in first public foreign visit to Egypt Damascus, Oct 17, 2016 (AFP) - Syrian security services chief Ali Mamluk met with Egyptian officials in his first public foreign visit in five years, state media in Damascus said on Monday.
State news agency SANA said Mamluk met with Egyptian head of general intelligence Khaled Fawzy and other "high-level security officials" during his one-day visit.

Depending on the question, 40-70 percent of respondents could not rate the work of ministers, LNT show "TOP 10 News" reports.
The third best rated minister is the Interior Minister Rihards Kozlovskis (Unity), who earned praise from only 14 percent of respondents, and the next four ministers - culture, agriculture, foreign affairs and health ministers - each received support of 11 percent of respondents.
Anda Caksa has been in the health minister's position for nearly four months and she believes that the public opinion is accurate, but she would appreciate a better result.
Caksa leads one of the most problematic fields, therefore it is only a matter of time that her ratings will decline, Kaktins estimates.
The survey also highlights which minister is viewed as the worst, and that is the Education Minister Karlis Sadurskis (Unity).
Respondents believe that he slows down the work of the government and is the least proficient and competent of all ministers.
Sadurskis, however, believes himself to be the only person in the government lead by Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis (Greens/Farmers) who has achieved the largest changes in his field.
Meanwhile, the second most-negatively viewed politician is the Justice Minister Dzintars Rasnacs (National Alliance), and the third is the Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics (Unity).

French court rejects bid to halt Calais camp demolition Lille, France, Oct 18, 2016 (AFP) - A group of French charities failed Tuesday in a last-ditch legal bid to block the razing of the so-called "Jungle" migrant camp in the northern town of Calais.
A court in the nearby city of Lille rejected their appeal which claimed that dismantling the camp was "an attack on the fundamental rights" of the migrants there, mostly Iraqis, Afghans and Sudanese.
The court ruled that the evacuation was intended to stop the "inhumane and degrading" treatment of people in the squalid camp by moving them to reception centres around the country.
Migrants and refugees routinely try to break into trucks heading to Britain, which they see as a more attractive destination than France for family or economic reasons.

"The growth of internet TV globally has ushered in a new golden age of content ."
"The levels of investment we are seeing from Netflix and Amazon are only topped by Disney ($11.84 billion) and NBC ($10.27 billion)," said IHS senior principal analyst Tim Westcott.
"We now plan to license content to existing online service providers in China rather than operate our own service in China in the near term ."

New Franco sculptures get egged in Barcelona Barcelona, Oct 17, 2016 (AFP) - The municipality of Barcelona on Monday unveiled a controversial exhibition on the late Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, which was promptly met with a hail of eggs by angry opponents.

Judge Bernadette Farnan sentenced Bradshaw on one charge of assault with intent to injure and, as well as the emotional harm payment, ordered him to pay a $500 fine along with courts costs. A media application to photograph Bradshaw was declined.
After Johnson fell to the ground, Bradshaw kicked him "like a conversion" as Johnson went to get to his feet.
Bradshaw argued on Monday, through defense council Liam Collins, that a conviction would mean he would be fired from a job he had had for the past three months after being fired from his last job as a result of the incident.
She also dismissed claims Bradshaw's daughter would suffer as a result of the conviction, as the girl's mother already had a conviction.
"Mr Bradshaw was the best behaved of the group," Collins said.
Bradshaw played four years of college basketball at Winthrop University in the United States before playing professionally with clubs in New Zealand, Australia, Spain, South Korea and Latvia from 2007 to 2012.
He represented the Tall Blacks' from 2004 to 2010, making his debut at the 2004 Olympic Games.

The ministry's Parliamentary Secretary Janis Eglits told LETA that the plan is still being considered, and that changes could still be made.
A task force meeting is scheduled for next week with the involved organizations, where this matter will be discussed.

Rail Baltic can not cross nature reserve near Salacgriva - European Commission RIGA, Oct 18 (LETA) - The European Commission has confirmed that the Rail Baltica high-speed rail line can not cross the Vitrupe Valley nature reserve near Salacgriva, LETA was informed by the Environmental Protection and Regional Development Ministry.
A meeting took place today in Brussels between representatives from Latvia and the European Commission regarding the Salacgriva stage of the Rail Baltica project, and whether or not the rail-line could go through the alternative C5 route crossing a Natura 2000 reserve in the Vitrupe Valley.
The Commission has concluded that the rail-line can not pass through the nature reserve, and called on Latvia to observe its environmental protection commitments.
If not alternative routes are possible, then allowing the rail line to pass through the territory of the nature reserve is only possible after all other EU environmental protection and nature regulations are met.
As reported, the Salacgriva regional council does not want to accept the Rail Baltica II route proposed by the government, as it runs through a relatively large area of agricultural land.
Proposal to merge local governments must be due to services provided to residents - Kucinskis RIGA, Oct 18 (LETA) - Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis (Greens/Farmers) believes that the Environmental Protection and Regional Development Ministry's proposal to create 16 new administrative territories, or districts, should be aimed at services provided to residents of these districts.
He emphasized that this will not be a new administrative territorial reform, but that local governments would be able to show that by cooperating more with one another, they would be able to more effectively deal with many matters.
As an example, the prime minister mentioned the current healthcare reforms, where it would be possible to test this cooperation in territories, like, for example, in the context of family physicians.
He said that discussions on the ministry's reforms must take place, and that the ministry must cooperate with other ministries when working on these reforms.
Environmental Protection and Regional Development Minister Kaspars Gerhards (National Alliance) was tasked by the government to come up with a new administrative territorial plan.
The ministry has prepared a project which foresees the creation of 16 administrative districts, and that consultations with local governments will be launched by the end of this year to move forward with this plan.

Liverpool and United fight out goalless draw London (dpa) - Liverpool and Manchester United fought out a 0-0 draw on Monday in a Premier League match that failed to deliver on the pre-match hype.
United goalkeeper David De Gea made two outstanding saves to deny Liverpool victory after a strong defensive effort from Jose Mourinho's side.
Liverpool, who would have gone joint-top with a win, were far from their fluent best and United prevented any clear-cut chances in the first half.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic had a chance for United early in the second half but headed tamely across goal and it was only when Adam Lallana replaced Daniel Sturridge 10 minutes into the second half that the hosts came to life.
United did n't even have a corner until the 80th minute when Marouane Fellani headed well wide and the match petered out into a draw.
Thus seven prosecutors' offices may be forced to halt their work as the Prosecutor General's Office has no spare premises, Prosecutor General Eriks Kalnmeiers told Saeima Defense, Internal Affairs and Corruption Prevention Committee meeting today.
"If on March 1 I am told to vacate the premises, then there will be a problem, as I do not know where these people could go," Kalnmeiers said.
The building at 113 Dzirnavu Street has been in need of renovation for many years and the situation has been discussed with various officials, but so far no alternative has emerged.
Kalnmeiers states in a letter to the highest government officials that with the building's critical condition there is a risk that the building, or some part thereof, may be shut down.
In October the BVKB tasked the building's owner to thoroughly examine it and calculate the load carrying capacity and stability of the building, determine the scope of damage and its effect on the building's mechanical durability and stability, as well as indicate the measures necessary for repairing the damage before March 1 next year.
"It is also necessary to determine whether the building, or individual parts of the building, are safe to the public," the BVKB report states.
The building's owner also must ensure that aluminum plates on the building's roof do not fall down on the street, and renovate the concrete steps at the main entrance.

Assange's internet cut by'state party ': WikiLeaks London, United Kingdom, Oct 17, 2016 (AFP) - WikiLeaks on Monday claimed Ecuador cut the internet connection of its founder Julian Assange, who is staying at the country's embassy in London, claiming the move was in response to the group's publication of documents related to US presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton.
"We can confirm Ecuador cut off Assange's internet access Saturday, 5pm GMT, shortly after publication of Clinton's Goldman Sachs speeches," WikiLeaks said on Twitter.
Three paid speeches to Goldman Sachs by US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton were released by WikiLeaks on Saturday, followed by the publication of further documents on Monday.
Assange has spent more than four years living in Ecuador's embassy in London, to avoid arrest and extradition to Sweden over an allegation of rape.

From the very start, the highest price was the main priority in the Citadele sale process, the Audit Office established.
At the same time, those who organized the deal had not taken into consideration all conditions of the deal specified by the European Commission and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
These conditions limited the government's decision-making rights during the sale process, as well as could affect prospective buyers' opinion about bank due to the restrictions applied to Citadele.
As a result, the process continued until the very last moment, leaving the government no room for maneuver so it could achieve more favorable conditions for the sale of Citadele shares, explains the Audit Office.
Given the importance and amount of the deal, and its effect on the state budget, the government should have created a special framework for further decisions on restructuring Parex Banka, including on the sale of Citadele bank, emphasizes the Audit Office.
Instead, the deal was organized pursuant to the Law On State and Local Government Capital Shares and Capital Companies, which did not ensure availability of all the necessary instruments to achieve that well thought out decisions were made in the interests of the state.
All the conceptual decisions during Citadele sale process were taken by the government.
Had all these factors been taken into consideration when the bank's sale strategy was being planned, the bank could have been sold faster and for higher price, the Audit Office concludes. The Audit Office believes that there are valuable lessons to be learned from the sale of Citadele bank.
Third, the Audit Office emphasizes the need for an independent supervisory authority.
Other such cases include Liepajas Metalurgs, airBaltic, there will also be decisions made concerning Lattelecom and Latvijas Mobilais Telefons shares, Rail Baltica and others, which will not only have effect on the national economy, but also may require substantial investments from the state budget.
As reported, 75 percent plus one Citadele shares that belonged to the state of Latvia were sold to a group of international investors represented by the investment company Ripplewood Advisors LLC.
The European Commission had earlier decided that the bank had to be sold by the end of 2014 and was not prepared to talk about extending the deadline.
Saeima parliamentary investigative commission has also concluded that Ripplewood Advisors LLC had in fact offered the lowest price for Citadele shares and the bank could have been sold at higher price.

Latvian pension system recognized as 7th most sustainable in the world RIGA, Oct 18 (LETA) - The 2016 Pension Sustainability Index compiled by German insurance company Allianz recognizes Latvian pension system as the seventh most sustainable in the world.
The study acknowledges that the Latvian pension system is based on quality fundamental principles.
"This is good news because it shows that Latvia's three-pillar pension system is effective and recognized by international experts," Ingus Alliks, state secretary of the Latvian Welfare Ministry, comments the index results in a statement to the media.
The most sustainable pension systems are in Australia, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Norway and New Zealand.
Altogether 54 countries were included in the study.
According to the study, Thailand and China are under the highest pressure to reform their systems.
The systems of these countries are not comprehensive and people at the age of retirement are at a risk of poverty.

Latvia has a three-pillar pension system.
The second or government-funded pension level implies that part of the social contributions by employees is invested in the finance sector, ensuring them bigger pensions in the future.

2ND LEAD; Montenegrin opposition refuses to recognize election result; By Boris Babic, dpa Podgorica (dpa) - The Montenegrin opposition said Monday evening that it will not recognize the result of parliamentary elections because of the influence of an alleged anti-terrorist raid carried out by police, the daily Vijesti reported online.
The four parties will not acknowledge the result because of what they said were massive abuses, including a statement that 20 Serbian nationals were arrested over terrorist plans to destabilize the country on the day of the election.
The four opposition parties, which won 39 or 40 of the 81 seats in parliament, demanded an international probe into the allegations of a terrorist plan.
Montenegro's combined opposition, which is partly pro-Russian, has long opposed the course towards NATO and EU membership set by Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic and his Democratic Party of Socialists, who declared victory after they won at least 35 seats.
"With our 36 seats and... our traditional partners, the coalition for the European future of Montenegro will doubtlessly have at least 42 seats," he told supporters celebrating the win.
No high-profile politicians involved in Jurmala scandal - Kucinskis RIGA, Oct 18 (LETA) - No high-profile politicians are involved in the recent Jurmala scandal, Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis (Greens/Farmers) said in an interview with Latvian Television this morning.
"I can assure you that no high-profile politicians are involved," said Kucinskis. He is not ruling out that the incident may have something to do with the upcoming elections.
Seeing how the Union of Greens and Farmers has "stumbled", the opposition may try to make it look worse.
"That's politics. If there is a coalition and opposition, there will always be something going on.
The question is how fair these games are played," said the premier.
As reported, former Jurmala Mayor Gatis Truksnis (Greens/Farmers), Jorens Raitums, a person who formerly associated with For Latvia From The Heart political party, and businessman Julijs Krumins are suspects in a criminal case on possible violations of party financing regulations, investigated by the Corruption Prevention Bureau.
Venezuela court raises new obstacle to recall vote Caracas, Oct 18, 2016 (AFP) - Venezuela's Supreme Court has raised another obstacle to an opposition drive for a referendum on recalling leftist President Nicolas Maduro, who is blamed for a deepening economic and political crisis.
Proponents of a recall already faced a high hurdle: they must collect signatures from 20 percent of the electorate -- or about four million voters -- over a three-day period from October 26 to 28.
But in a ruling Monday the Supreme Court raised the bar even higher by making it 20 percent of the electorate in each of the country's 24 states in order to force a recall vote.
"The failure to collect that percentage in any of the states or the capital district would nullify the validity of a presidential recall referendum," the court said.
"It will be a moral recall," said Jesus Torrealba, MUD's executive secretary.
Cycling: 2017 Tour with less hills suits Froome Paris, Oct 18, 2016 (AFP) - Tour de France organisers on Tuesday unveiled a 2017 course light on mountain climbs that should boost reigning champion Chris Froome's bid for a fourth title.
There are only five real mountain stages, fewer than 2016.
"This Tour de France route has been designed to be won by a true champion," Tour director Christian Prudhomme insisted, without naming Froome, winner in 2013, 2015 and 2016 or any favourite.
Contrary to nearly all the preceding Tours there will never be more than two consecutive days of climbing either.

YouTube's content chief Susanne Daniels told MIPCOM, the world's biggest entertainment convention held in the French resort of Cannes, that it was using data from its more than a billion viewers to give them what they want.
"Our thesis is simple. Identify YouTube's most engaging stars and top genres, and invest in the content that fans tell us they want.
It is currently only available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand but will be rolled out into other countries next year.

Football: Cuadrado strikes as 10-man Juve sink Lyon Lyon, Oct 18, 2016 (AFP) - Juan Cuadrado came off the bench to score a late winner as 10-man Juventus beat Lyon 1-0 in France in Champions League Group H on Tuesday.
The Italian champions saw Gianluigi Buffon save a first-half Alexandre Lacazette penalty and then had Mario Lemina sent off early in the second period.
"It's never easy to win away from home," said Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri.
"I should thank Mario Lemina for his sending-off because I thought we played better with a man less," he added.
"What more do you want us to do," Lyon captain Maxime Gonalons told beIN Sports after the home side failed to find a way past an often inspired Buffon. "We gave everything.
- Brilliant Buffon - Lyon were struggling to get into the game but they won a penalty in the 34th minute when Leonardo Bonucci was penalised for wrestling Diakhaby to the floor at a corner.
"He does n't need to be defended by anybody.
He is quite simply different to the rest," Allegri said of his veteran goalkeeper. In between Buffon's saves, the visitors had been reduced to 10 men in the 54th minute when French midfielder Lemina was shown a second yellow card for a foul on Fekir, although he had appeared to take the ball.
DiCaprio's 2013 film about Wall Street corruption and greed was financed by Red Granite Pictures, co-founded by Riza Aziz, stepson of the Malaysian prime minister.
The Justice Department wants to seize royalties from the film, as well as real estate in Beverly Hills, New York and London, artworks by Monet and Van Gogh, and a Bombardier jet.
A Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation spokesperson said that after hearing about the lawsuit, DiCaprio's had his representatives contact the Justice Department "to determine whether he or his foundation... ever received any gifts or charitable donations directly or indirectly related to these parties, and if so, to return those gifts or donations as soon as possible ."
The move to seize the funds, which is subject to what could be lengthy legal proceedings, emerges from a 2010 Justice Department anti-kleptocracy initiative intended to confiscate the ill-gotten gains of world leaders which pass through the US banking system.
The Bruno Manser Fund, a Swiss NGO campaigning against corruption in Malaysia, said Tuesday it welcomed DiCaprio's announcement but called on the actor to fully disclose his financial ties to Low, Aziz and Red Granite Pictures.
"DiCaprio's public statement leaves key questions open," said Lukas Straumann, the executive director of the Bruno Manser Fund.
"How much money did Leonardo DiCaprio and his foundation get from Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) from Malaysia and why did n't he conduct due diligence upon receiving these funds ?"
"While we appreciate the statement and his cooperation with the Department of Justice, there is clearly more DiCaprio could do to end this disgraceful chapter in Hollywood history," the statement said.

"We are telling Daesh that their leaders are abandoning them.
"Where they are going, I will leave that to our (missile) targeteers to take care of," Volesky said.
He noted that the Iraqis would screen anyone leaving Mosul, and attempts by foreign fighters to blend in to an expected exodus of displaced people would be thwarted.

"I insisted that internal and external security, education and health care as well as demographic issues should be the priorities," the Latvian president said, adding that the draft national budget for 2017 was another step towards raising the defense budget to 2 percent of GDP in 2018.

Compared to the 2016 budget, budget revenues are projected to grow by EUR 664 million and expenditures by EUR 681 million.
The government is determined to revise the budget on a regular basis also in the future, the Finance Ministry said.

Russia extends planned Aleppo truce to 11 hours: ministry Moscow, Oct 19, 2016 (AFP) - Russia said Wednesday it was extending an eight-hour truce in Aleppo, which is planned for Thursday, to 11 hours to allow civilians and rebels to leave the city's rebel-held east.
The humanitarian pause, which was to run from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm (0500 GMT to 1300 GMT), has been extended "by three hours until 7:00 pm (1600 GMT)," senior military official Sergei Rudskoi said at a briefing at the defence ministry in Moscow.
The extra time "will allow representatives of the United Nations and the Syrian Red Crescent to carry out all their operations to ensure the evacuation of the sick and wounded, and also to allow peaceful civilians out of the city," the military spokesman said.
Moscow announced on Tuesday morning that Russian and Syrian air forces had stopped bombing Aleppo ahead of the pause in fighting and the halt held into a second day on Wednesday.
According to Moscow, once the pause begins six corridors out of the city will open for civilians with another two -- via the Castello Road in the north and Souk al-Hal in the city centre -- designated for rebels.
Four German police wounded in raid on far-right Berlin, Oct 19, 2016 (AFP) - Four German police officers were wounded, some of them seriously, when a member of the far-right "Citizens of the Reich" group opened fire during a raid Wednesday, authorities said.
Local authorities had ordered the seizure of the man's firearms, for which he had a permit, because they were deemed to be "faulty".
It was the second incident in three months involving the Reichsbuerger, which does not recognise the legitimacy of the German republic and believes in the continued existence of the German empire or "Reich".
The suspect was seriously wounded and three police officers suffered light injuries.
Although the amount is not very large, it would still help, the agriculture minister said, adding that not every farm lost as much as one-third or half of its grain harvest.
The quality of grain harvested after heavy rains this year seriously deteriorated and many Latvian farmers had to sell food-grade wheat as feed-grade wheat.
The 37-year-old became the 44th player in National Hockey League history to reach the milestone before leaving the game after being hit by the puck in the third period.
"To tell you the truth, it just felt great," said Hossa, who had let out a roar of "Yeah baby !" after his score.
"Great reception from the fans.
I'm just glad to be part of the company and thank all my teammates who I've played with," local media quoted him as saying.
The right wing has been selected on five All Star Games and played in three consecutive Stanley Cup finals for three different teams before finally winning the title with Chicago in 2010. rcw/jm

Latvia's general government budget ran EUR 309 million deficit in 2015 RIGA, Oct 20 (LETA) - In 2015, Latvia's general government budget ran a deficit of EUR 309 million, or 1.3 percent of GDP, according to the Central Statistical Bureau's (CSB) report, which has been drawn up in line with the methodology of the European System of Accounts (ESA 2010).
As compared to the previous period, the central government budget deficit increased by EUR 18.6 million in 2015, reaching EUR 421.5 million.
Compared to the cash flow data included in the Finance Ministry's annual report, where the consolidated budget deficit of 2015 was indicated as EUR 373.5 million or 1.5 percent of GDP, the budget deficit calculated by the CSB in accordance with the methodological requirements of ESA 2010 is EUR 64.5 million, or 0.27 percent lower.
Adjustments have been made in accordance with the methodological requirements of ESA 2010 by excluding financial transactions from the government sector balance, neutralizing the impact of EU funds and including data on companies that have been reclassified to the general government sector.
The calculations of the October 2016 notification have been based on the data provided by the Finance Ministry, Treasury, State Social Insurance Agency, CSB, Riga City Council, State Real Estate Agency and institutions involved in the management of foreign funds.
The Notification on General Government Budget Deficit and Debt is submitted to the European Commission in accordance with EU regulations.
The results of the notification are used to assess EU member states' compliance with the criteria established by the Maastricht Treaty, that is, the ratio of the general government budget deficit to the GDP at current prices must not exceed 3 percent and the ratio of the government debt to the gross domestic product at current prices must be no more than 60 percent.

Think tank: Baltic defense budgets growing faster than in any other region globally TALLINN, Oct 20, BNS - Since the Ukraine crisis began, the Baltic countries' orders for new defense equipment have doubled and will double again in the next two years, according to an analysis released by IHS Markit on Thursday.
Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia increased spending on new defense equipment from 210 million U.S. dollars in 2014 to 390 million dollars in 2016. Together by 2018, the three countries are expected to spend around 670 million dollars a year on new equipment.
"The profile of defense spending in the Baltics has changed dramatically in the past two years," said Craig Caffrey, principal analyst at IHS Jane's.
"Their defense budgets will all be over two percent of GDP by 2018, and each country will have doubled or tripled their budgets from 10 years ago.
In 2005, the region's total defense budget was 930 million dollars. By 2020, the region's defense budget will be 2.1 billion dollars.
Latvia and Lithuania have been the two fastest growing defense budgets in the world since 2014, according to IHS Jane's analysis. The high rates of growth will be sustained until 2018.
"The increase in defense spending in the Baltics is largely linked to the growing confrontation between Russia and the West, often described as the'new Cold War '," said Alex Kokcharov, principal analyst at IHS Country Risk.
"While we do not expect Russia to become involved in a conventional interstate war with the West, including NATO member states, it is likely that the confrontation will continue for a number of years," Kokcharov said.
The 28.6 percent increase in the defence budget for 2015, the largest since 2002, is expected to represent the zenith of Russian defense expenditure for the foreseeable future, according to the IHS Jane's report.
"Russia is well positioned in high growth markets such as Vietnam, Indonesia and India," Moores said. "However, it faces increasingly competition in all three from North American and European companies and will have to adopt new strategies to retain market share ."

InFrame by Brave Bison One of the reasons why the movie Trainspotting was so beloved back in 1996 was its soundtrack, full of stars from the contemporary world of Britpop such as Elastica, Pulp, Underworld and Leftfield.
But one of the biggest names in music was missing: that of Oasis, the biggest name on the scene.
It turns out that the Manchester legends were offered the opportunity to record a track for the movies, but that Noel Gallagher turned it down because he presumed the film to actually be about trainspotters, rather than poverty-stricken heroin addicts in Edinburgh.
It picks up the film’s original cast of Ewan McGregor, Jonny Lee Miller, Robert Carlyle and Ewen Bremner as they live their lives two decades later.

Reports: Lippi expected to take over as China's head coach BEIJING (AP) — World Cup-winning manager Marcello Lippi is reportedly on the verge of returning to China as a coach, this time as head of the national team rather than the big-spending club where he spent three years.

The ban has been declared "unconstitutional and void," it said.
Catalonia's regional parliament voted to abolish bullfighting from January 1, 2012 after animal rights groups managed to garner 180,000 signatures for a petition.
- Politically sensitive - Critics at the time argued that more than an animal rights issue, Catalonia's ban was also politically-motivated in a region with its own language, a fierce sense of identity and a desire to seek independence from Spain.
As such, the court decision is likely to increase already-high tensions between Madrid and Catalonia, where the regional government is making moves to separate from Spain and has announced a referendum on the issue next year.
Iraq forces retale town east of Mosul: commander Arbil, Iraq, Oct 20, 2016 (AFP) - Iraq's elite counter-terrorism service (CTS) on Thursday retook full control of Bartalla, a small Christian town to the east of Mosul which the Islamic State group seized two years ago.
CTS commander Taleb Sheghati al-Kenani announced the jihadists' defeat in Bartalla on television from the town, which lies less than 15 kilometres (9 miles) from the eastern edge of Mosul.
"I announce to the people of Bartalla and Mosul we have complete control over Bartalla.
Its residents, its churches and all of its infrastructure are now under the control of CTS," he said.
He stressed that control of Bartalla, which is now one of the spots where Iraqi forces are closest to Mosul, was key to the major offensive launched four days earlier.

Customs Police seize hashish worth more than EUR 2 million at Latvian-Lithuanian border RIGA, Oct 20 (LETA) - The State Revenue Service's Customs Police earlier this month seized over 200 kilograms of hashish at the Latvian-Lithuanian border, worth more than EUR 2 million, the Customs Police's Chief Kaspars Podins told reporters today.

The drivers of both vehicles, Estonian nationals, were detained and are currently in police custody.
If something happens in one of the Baltic states, in all likelihood, it will happen also in the two other Baltic states, because there is intercorrelation of economic processes and development.
There is no recession now and it is not expected in the near future, the economist said.
With new economic disasters unlikely to strike anytime soon, people are going to be much more confident about their ability to buy real estate.
External factors' impact on the property market will be rather limited, Hansen predicted, adding that the European Central Bank will continue to print money, interest rates will remain low, just like inflation, while new banking crises are not in the forecast for Europe.
The only effect might be on the mobility of workforce, as some of the guest workers currently residing in Britain will probably want to return, but these processes will be rather minimal and their effect on the property market will be insignificant, Hansen said.
The economist believes that demographic trends will have the most significant impact on the market in following years.
At present, there are about 280,000 people in Latvia who might be able to buy real estate, but after 2020 their number will be down to 200,000, which is a substantial reduction, which will affect the market.
Gun with which Verlaine shot Rimbaud up for auction The Guardian Christie’s to sell weapon fired in 1873 in what would be the culmination of a torrid affair between the French poets The most famous gun in French literature, the revolver with which the poet Paul Verlaine tried to kill his lover, Arthur Rimbaud, is going under the hammer, Christie’s has said.
The 29-year-old poet had abandoned his young wife and child to be with Rimbaud, who would later become a symbol of rebellious youth.
However, after an opium- and absinthe-soaked stay in London that would inspire Rimbaud’s Une Saison en Enfer (A Season in Hell), Verlaine wanted to go back to his wife.
“Here’s how I will teach you how to leave! ” he shouted, before firing twice at Rimbaud.
Verlaine, who was to be dogged by drink and drug addiction all his life, pulled out the revolver again and threatened him with it in the street.
The gun was confiscated and later fell into the hands of a private owner, Christie’s said.
It estimates the gun could make up to €60,000 (£54,000) at an auction in Paris on 30 November.
He warned, however, that the planned evacuation of several hundred people would be difficult.
"This is Syria.
Everything can go wrong at every possible opportunity," he says.

Russian theatre cancels Jesus Christ Superstar after'blasphemy 'accusations Moscow, Oct 19, 2016 (AFP) - A Siberian theatre triggered a storm Wednesday by cancelling a staging of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical "Jesus Christ Superstar" after a pro-Kremlin nationalist group condemned it as blasphemy.
In a report from Omsk, Regnum news agency wrote Wednesday that the scandal "has prompted a major public reaction".
It quoted art critic Vadim Klimov as saying: "Today you can not say that Russia is a secular state ."
An obscure group called Family, Love, Fatherland had appealed to regional authorities to stop the staging and applied to hold a demonstration, accusing the long-running musical of "non-stop blasphemy" and "mockery of faith".
Amnesty International called the cancellation of the show "the latest example of interference in Russian cultural life by nationalist'activists' ."
The Omsk diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church also denied any "interference" in the theatre's repertoire.
The musical was first staged in Russia in 1990 during Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika reforms.

"If I am saying that I hope an agreement will be found in the next couple of days, this does include today ."
He denied that the European Union summit, which wraps up on Friday, was the deadline for the deal.
Juncker has warned that if the EU fails to reach such an agreement with Canada, it will likely scupper trade talks with other parts of the world, including ongoing negotiations with the United States.
The Namur parliament last week voted to block the deal, known as CETA -- meaning that Belgium can not sign up to the pact and leaving the deal in limbo after seven years of negotiations.
The hold up also threatens to torpedo next week's planned visit to Brussels by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to sign the deal.
CETA would link the EU market of 500 million people with the world's 10th biggest economy.
While consisting largely of the funk maestro's best-known hits from early and mid-career, "Prince 4Ever" will also feature the unreleased 1982 track "Moonbeam Levels ."
It would have appeared on "Rave Unto The Joy Fantastic," an unfinished album Prince discarded in the late 1980s.
Warner, which had agreed with Prince on remastering the "Purple Rain" recordings before his death, said it would announce more details including a release date later.
Prince in the early 1990s changed his name to the unpronounceable "love symbol" and wrote "slave" on his cheek to protest contractual terms by Warner, which sought to pace his prolific output.
When he died of an accidental painkiller overdose, Prince left no will but vaults full of unreleased material at his Paisley Park estate in Minnesota.

These decisions have made us much stronger," she admitted.
Both officials also touched on the many global challenges facing not only the EU, but impacting also Latvia and Estonia.

Brussels (dpa) - There will be no free trade deal between the European Union and the United States in the near future, and big changes are needed if it is ever going to happen, French President Francois Hollande said Friday.
"There will be no agreement before the end of the year.
We need to pursue talks with the new US administration but there can be no date today and TTIP must be fundamentally reviewed if one day it will exist," Hollande said.
He spoke after a two-day EU summit in Brussels overshadowed by an impasse on an EU-Canada trade deal, known as the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), and widely seen as a blueprint for TTIP.
Seven Pakistan troops killed in Kashmir border fire: India New Delhi, Oct 21, 2016 (AFP) - Indian border security forces on Friday said they shot dead seven Pakistani soldiers in retaliation to a ceasefire violation on the disputed Kashmir border, with Pakistan refuting the claims.
India's Border Security Force (BSF) said Pakistan Rangers targeted Indian positions with sniper fire early Friday, following a failed attempt by militants overnight to enter the Indian side in Hira Nagar near the main city of Jammu in Indian-controlled Kashmir.
BSF spokesman Shubhendu Bhardwaj told AFP that they had launched an "aggressive offensive" after one of their soldiers was critically injured by sniper fire from across the border.
"There was an infiltration attempt and sniper fire.
The bodies are on the other side of the border," said Bhardwaj.
Pakistan army spokesman Lieutenant General Asim Bajwa refuted the claim and accused India of unprovoked firing on the border.
Anti-India sentiment runs deep in Kashmir, where rebel groups have fought Indian troops since 1989 for either independence or a merger with Pakistan.
Around 500 officers, most dressed in civilian clothes and some with their faces partly covered, protested near the Eiffel Tower.
"Police officers need recognition," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said earlier Thursday.
On October 8, a 28-year-old officer suffered serious burns when he was attacked with a petrol bomb on the outskirts of the capital.
He remains in a coma.
Police unions, which have already met with Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, are demanding a meeting with President Francois Hollande and calling for fixed minimum sentences for attacks on the police.
Second Stockholm refugee centre fire in a week Stockholm, Oct 21, 2016 (AFP) - A home for asylum seekers was set on fire in a Stockholm suburb early Friday, the second such incident in the Swedish capital in less than a week, police said.
The nine asylum seekers living of the centre in the well-heeled northern suburb of Sigtuna and two staff members were evacuated before firefighters arrived shortly before 2 am, media said.
Sweden accepted the second highest number of refugees per capita in the European Union in 2015 as the continent struggles with its worst migration crisis since World War II.
The nation saw a wave of around 20 arson attacks against refugee centres last year, but the culprits have rarely been caught.
Senior Revenue Service official Cerneckis submits resignation RIGA, Oct 21 (LETA) - Kaspars Cerneckis, head of the State Revenue Service's Tax Debt Collection Administration, handed in his resignation this morning, as Cerneckis confirmed to LETA.
"I'll make no comment right now.
At the end of August, the Administrative Regional Court upheld the Administrative Court's decision to reject Cerneckis' claim contesting his transfer from the post of the Revenue Service's deputy head to the Tax Debt Collection Administration.
Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Greens/Farmers) commented that Cerneckis had failed in his job and was now trying to stop the changes at the Revenue Service.
"The fact that he has not agreed to be rotated to a different job outside the Revenue Service is obstructionism.
He can not work as the deputy head and give instructions to the heads of the Customs Police and Financial Police any longer - of course he is not happy," said the minister.

Domuss to invest EUR 50 million in real estate projects next two years RIGA, Oct 21 (LETA) - Real estate development company Domuss intends to invest EUR 40-50 million in its real estate projects until the end of 2018, Domuss director Ralfs Jansons told LETA.

The total investment in Mezaparka Residences stands at EUR 19.5 million, and by the end of 2018 investments in planning and construction will amount to another EUR 18-20 million.
"The 80-apartment building will be finished in the second half of 2018," Jansons said.
Domuss has acquired several hundred hectares of land around Riga in locations suitable for logistics centers and warehouses.
"We are currently planning projects for construction of warehouses and we will decide on whether to build them or not next year.
We are in talks with real estate consultants on the possibilities of attracting tenants for these facilities," Jansons said.
Domuss is a company that belongs to the U.S. investment fund NCH, which has been operating in the Latvian real estate market since 1995.
NCH develops real estate projects also in Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Moldova, Romania and Albania.
“We want to get into every smartphone” to counter Russian disinformation, said Milan Chovanec, the Czech interior minister.
The Czech counter-intelligence service said in September that Russia was conducting “an information war” in the Czech Republic, putting in place propaganda agents to destabilise the country.
Speaking at a conference on strategic communications alongside General Petr Pavel, head of Nato’s military committee, Chovanec said a 20-member team in his ministry would act to tackle Russian propaganda in the public domain in real time, including on social media, and train public officials to deal with it.
Dozens of websites in the Czech Republic – home to 30,000 Russians as of a 2011 census – promote Moscow’s stance toward the west.
The Czech Republic has stuck to the common European Union stance towards Russia. But a number of politicians – in particular President Milos Zeman – have echoed Russia’s views on the situation in eastern Ukraine, including its insistence that no Russian troops are there, and spoken out against economic sanctions on Russia.

Until now, the BND could only monitor up to 20 percent of traffic at one exchange point.
"We want a judicial clarification and legal security for our clients and companies," said a spokesman for DE-CIX.
The new law bans the BND from spying on countries in the European Union and its citizens, as well as EU institutions, except in the case of suspected terrorist activity.
It also requires the BND to submit requests for cooperation with other spy agencies with a parliamentary committee and bans the agency from carrying out industrial espionage.
It requires the head of the BND, the chancellor's office and an independent panel of judges to approve strategic foreign espionage activities.
Critics also chafe at what they call ambiguous formulations of the conditions under which the BND is required to conduct spying activities.
Under old rules, fighting criminality, war, terrorism and cyber attacks were threats that the agency was mandated to monitor.

We can learn a lot from Estonia, as they already have many things that we are only just planning to implement," Vejonis said, adding that the countries should share their experience of solving various problems.
Vejonis told the press conference that he and the Estonian president have similar education, which will allow them to work together in making the Baltic countries the greenest region in the world.

UN rights council sets up probe into Aleppo violence Geneva, Oct 21, 2016 (AFP) - The UN rights council on Friday called for a special investigation into violence in Aleppo in a resolution fiercely critical of Syria's government.
Moscow's envoy to the council, Aleksei Goltiaev, also described criticism of Syria and Russia as "pathetic".
The resolution called for the UN's existing Commission of Inquiry for Syria (COI) to "conduct a comprehensive, independent special inquiry into the events in Aleppo", and to identify individuals responsible for the most serious violations.
The resolution demanded that warring parties "in particular the Syrian authorities and their allies", allow unrestricted humanitarian access to desperate civilians and "end immediately all bombardments and military flights over Aleppo city".
It also condemned "the starvation of civilians as a means of combat".
East Aleppo, captured by the rebels in 2012, has not received aid since July 7 when regime forces seized the last supply route.
A so-called "humanitarian pause", initiated by Russia, has been broadly holding since Thursday in east Aleppo but the UN and Red Cross have not yet gained access to the rebel side of the city.

Football: Pogba purrs as Man United trounce Fenerbahce Manchester, United Kingdom, Oct 20, 2016 (AFP) - Paul Pogba struck twice as Manchester United invigorated their Europa League campaign with a classy 4-1 home victory over Turkish giants Fenerbahce on Thursday.
Anthony Martial, with another penalty, and Jesse Lingard were also on target as Jose Mourinho's team secured a win that left them level on six points with Feyenoord at the top of Group A.
"We knew after the first defeat (1-0 at Feyenoord) it was important to get nine points at home and a few more away, so it was a very important victory for us ."
"The first 30 minutes, the game was balanced, with United having more possession, but not creating many chances," said Fenerbahce coach Dick Advocaat.
"But if you give goals away against a team like United, with the quality they have, you're asking for problems ."
The result vindicated Mourinho's decision to make seven changes to the team that had held in-form Liverpool to a 0-0 draw on Monday.
With Juan Mata prominent in the number 10 role, United's build-up play was neat, but they showed next to no threat until they were awarded a 31st-minute penalty.
Mourinho raised his finger to the sky and walked straight down the touchline to the tunnel.
Within three minutes of kick-off in the second half, United were four goals to the good as Rooney laid off Pogba's pass to Lingard, who drove a crisp shot past Demirel from 20 yards.
"My name is the Austrian Fox and now I'm staying with the English Foxes," he told the club website.
"I'm happy. I'm committed to the Club.
We had a great last season and we've also done well so far this season in the Champions League," said Fuchs.
"I've had the best time of my career so far here.
Fuchs plans to retire to the United States where his family reside and where he has business interests.

Defence Minister: Russian Smolensk report ‘falsified’ polijas radio Recordings of a 2010 meeting between Vladimir Putin and Donald Tusk prove that an official Polish report was a direct copy of a “falsified” Russian report on the Smolensk presidential plane crash, Poland’s defence minister has said.
Macierewicz said that the recordings cast doubt on reports by the Russian Interstate Aviation Committee (MAK) and Poland’s own investigation led by then-Interior Minister Jerzy Miller.
“I would say that this is the latest piece of evidence which shows that the whole of the Miller report was a direct copy of [the MAK report], which was in turn falsified so as to... hide [the truth] from the public, ” Macierewicz told the public TVP broadcaster on Wednesday.
“This is the importance of these recordings, and it is huge because it paints a picture [of the final moments before the tragedy] which is a direct contradiction of the MAK report and that by Miller, ” Macierewicz said.
All 96 people on board, including Polish President Lech Kaczyñski, were killed in the disaster

Language at UK talks not decided says EU's'Monsieur Brexit' Brussels, Oct 21, 2016 (AFP) - The European Commission's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said Friday that the official language of talks with Britain had yet to be decided, denying reports that he had insisted they be in his native French.
"Never expressed myself on negotiation language," Barnier, a former French agriculture minister and France's one-time European Commissioner, said on Twitter.
Barnier's appointment by Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker in July was dubbed a "declaration of war" by British media while he remains loathed in the City of London for taking on the banking sector while he was financial services commissioner.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there would be nothing unusual in European officials being allowed to use their mother tongue during talks.
"If I am well informed, everybody here is allowed to speak his language. And since Mr Barnier is a French citizen, it's not unnatural that he speaks French, the way I speak German," she said.
"I was called the most dangerous man in Europe, and (yet) finally we succeeded to build a clever global financial regulation agenda, with the UK on board," Barnier said in September. dk/ar/ri

The men, who spoke only Arabic, beat some of the migrants with clubs, causing panic which caused most of them to fall into the sea, the spokesman said.
According to the UN, at least 3,654 people have died trying to cross the Mediterranean this year.
The Italian interior ministry said Tuesday that more than 145,000 migrants had landed in Italy so far this year, a figure similar to that of the previous two years.

One of the main reasons for high unemployment among ex-convicts is that most lack skills required on the market, explained Steina.
Of these, 140 ex-convicts have found jobs with the help of the Employment Agency.
Commenting on the Employment Agency's role in the project on ex-convicts' integration in society and labor market, Steina said that the agency was planning to provide consultation to 586 persons a year on the average.

"Medical evacuations of sick and injured could unfortunately not begin this morning as planned because the necessary conditions were not in place," said Jens Laerke, spokesman for the United Nations humanitarian office.
The head of the UN's humanitarian taskforce for Syria, Jan Egeland, said Thursday that all the "green lights" needed to start medical evacuations on Friday had been given, including from the rebels that control east Aleppo, Syria's government and its key backer Russia.
But Laerke told reporters those "assurances as to the security conditions" had not been provided and that emergency relief workers had so far been unable to deploy from positions in government-controlled west Aleppo.
"This is an astronomically difficult operation," he said.
"The tax will increase more for those automobiles whose CO2 emissions fall in the ranges of 250 grams to 300 grams per kilometer, 300 grams to 350 grams per kilometer, and more than 350 grams per kilometer.
The new tax will apply to approximately 92,000 automobiles, and to more than 111,000 automobiles in 2019.

However, that would obviously lead to a reduction in the number of teachers.
"Most teachers in Latvia work half time, which indicates to a lack of students, a faulty school network and insufficient capacity of school buildings, or the need to build new schools in the Greater Riga region," Sadurskis explained.
The politician said that the new model would help reduce the disproportions among regions and solving problems in the school network.
"Not even the best teacher wage model will achieve an optimal result if there is no coordination between municipalities, because they distribute earmarked subsidies for schools.
There are municipalities for which we do not have information on the distribution of subsidies," the minister said.
Next spring the Education and Science Ministry will offer all 119 municipalities its vision of an optimal school network in Latvia.

"It seems obvious to me, to Canada, that the European Union is incapable now of having an international agreement, even with a country with such European values as Canada, and even with a country as kind and patient as Canada," Freeland said on Belgian television.
"Canada is disappointed, me personally, I'm very disappointed," Freeland said in unusually strong and emotional remarks.
"I worked very, very hard, but I think it's impossible.
We have decided to return home and I am very, very sad.

EU drops sanctions threat against Russia over Syria BRUSSELS, Oct 21 (LETA -- AFP) - European Union leaders backed down Friday from an explicit threat of sanctions against Russia over the bombing of Aleppo but warned that they would consider "all available options" if atrocities in Syria continue.
The watered-down statement said the EU "strongly condemns the attacks by the Syrian regime and its allies, notably Russia, on civilians in Aleppo" and called for an "immediate cessation of hostilities ."
"The EU is considering all available options, should the current atrocities continue," it added.
EU President Donald Tusk, who had earlier said that sanctions should be on the table, insisted that the leaders had agreed to "keep the unity of the EU" over Russia.
The leaders brought up Russian "airspace violations, disinformation campaigns, cyber-attacks, interference in political processes in the Balkans and beyond" and other issues.
"Given these examples it is clear that Russia's strategy is to weaken the EU," said Tusk, the former prime minister of Poland.
Renzi, at whose request the EU held the discussion on Russia, said the priority had to be to "make all possible efforts to find a peace deal in Syria ."
"I believe there would n't have been any sense in inserting a reference to sanctions, while the rest of the statement was what foreign ministers approved on Monday," he told reporters.
Thousands of gay men in UK to be pardoned for now-abolished sex offenses London (CNN) Tens of thousands of gay and bisexual men who were convicted of now-abolished sexual offenses in Britain will be posthumously pardoned, the government announced Thursday.
The government proposal will also make it easier for living Britons, convicted years ago of since-decriminalized sexual behavior, to clear their names.
But under the new law, the government will automatically pardon living men convicted of historical sexual offenses "who would be innocent of any crime today," Justice Minister Sam Gyimah said in a statement.
Private homosexual acts for men aged over 21 were decriminalized in England and Wales in 1967. However the law was not changed in Scotland until 1980 or in Northern Ireland until 1982

South Africa had already warned earlier that it might pull out of the ICC.
The simple words “winner of the Nobel prize in literature”, which appeared on the page for The Lyrics: 1961-2012, have now been removed.
That single sentence was the sole public recognition Dylan had given to the prestigious award, announced last week in Stockholm.
In July 1966, following a motorcycle crash at the peak of his fame, Dylan disappeared from public view.
Though it was claimed he had broken several vertebrae, he was never treated in hospital, and he later admitted in his autobiography, Chronicles: “I had been in a motorcycle accident and I’d been hurt, but I recovered.
Though it is, of course, less likely that his manager, Jeff Rosen, would be unaware.
“My only caveat about the award is that it cheapens Dylan to be associated at all with a prize founded on an explosives and armaments fortune, ” Will Self told the Guardian.
According to the letter obtained by LETA, it has been addressed to President Raimonds Vejonis, Saeima Speaker Inara Murniece (National Alliance), Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis (Greens/Farmers), Environmental Protection and Regional Development Minister Kaspars Gerhards (National Alliance), and Riga Mayor Nils Usakovs (Harmony).
The letter was signed by MEPs Sandra Kalniete (Unity), Krisjanis Karins (Unity), Artis Pabriks (Unity), Inese Vaidere (Unity), as well as Roberts Zile (National Alliance). In the letter, the MEPs point out to the fact that the new tram line project will cross the historical Lielie Kapi Cemetery, which is a protected national cultural landmark.
''This cemetery was closed and during the Soviet era due to political reasons, and subsequently vandalized. A street was also constructed across the cemetery.
The proposed tram line would be a continuation of this amoral Soviet policy.
Riga Mayor Nils Usakovs (Harmony) said that the Skanste Street neighborhood in Riga is one of the fastest developing neighborhoods in the city, and is becoming a center for new offices, residential buildings and other structures.
He said that this new tram line will allow residents to use public transportation more frequently to get to the city center.
''This is the best possible solution.
Formula One: Verstappen, Red Bull dominate final practice Austin, Oct 22, 2016 (AFP) - Dutch teenager Max Verstappen topped the times ahead of his Red Bull team-mate Australian Daniel Ricciardo in Saturday morning's disjointed third and final practice ahead of Sunday's United States Grand Prix.
The Red Bull pair took advantage of Mercedes' reluctance to show their full potential in the closing minutes of the session as Kimi Raikkonen clocked the third best time for Ferrari.
Defending three-time champion Lewis Hamilton was fourth fastest and his Mercedes team-mate and championship leader Nico Rosberg sixth, but both ran late without clocking laps on super-soft tyres.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest as well noted on Friday that Russia had declined to participate in the OSCE mission, raising questions about their intentions.
"It's appropriate that people might be suspicious of their motives or at least their motives might be different than what they have publicly stated, given the nefarious activities that they've engaged in in cyberspace," he said.
"Absolutely," replied Kasparov, when asked on CNN's "The Lead" whether he agrees with "the premise that the White House puts forward that Russia is trying to elect Donald Trump ?"
"I do n't believe for a second that Trump was clean and they could n't find anything," he said.
"More likely, they had plenty but they decided to use it privately to good effect, whether we are talking about debts or blackmail ."
"Trump shows no respect for democracy or rule of law ."

The December 4 vote hinges on proposals to curb the powers of the upper chamber of parliament and regions.
A Corriere della Sera newspaper article presenting the Ipsos survey noted that support for the'yes' option shrank to 46 per cent from 57 per cent at the start of the year.
However, the percentages only refer to people who have already made up their mind.
Taking into account the entire electorate, 42.3 per cent of respondents plan to abstain, 8.5 per cent are undecided, 26.8 per cent want to vote'no 'and 22.4 per cent are for a'yes,' meaning that the referendum outcome is still uncertain, Ipsos said.
Polling suggests that the'no 'camp is strongest in Italy's empoverished southern regions, as well as among younger voters, those with lower educational qualifications, the working class, the unemployed and students.

Iniesta could now return in time to face Real Madrid in the first El Clasico of the season on December 3. However, he will miss Barca's Champions League trips to Manchester City and Celtic next month.
Coach Luis Enrique was incensed when Valencia's Argentine midfielder Enzo Perez escaped without even a yellow card for the challenge that caused the injury.
Messi has returned in fine form, though, as his sixth goal in three games since his comeback deep into stoppage time from the penalty spot moved Barca to the top of La Liga.
"I think there is a 70 percent (probability) that we will work in the opposition," Butkevicius told journalists on Sunday after casting his ballot in the 2nd round of elections in Naujamiestis constituency.
In Butkevicius' words, one of the reasons behind the defeat in the 1st round of elections was the little time spent on the election campaign.
"As the party's leader, I thought and many other MPs of our party thought that the society saw the work that we had done and would therefore give us the mandate to continue to continue the other tasks.
I have to admit that I spent very little time on the election campaign, I worked in the government during the campaign and addressed problems there but now when I think about it – I should have spent more time on meeting the public and the election campaign in an effort to mobilize our team members," said the prime minister.

Thousands of women protest against Venezuela's Maduro Caracas (dpa) - Thousands of women dressed in white protested against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Saturday, two days after a citizen's vote to remove him from office was blocked.
The protesters were led along one of the main motorways in the capital Caracas by Lilian Tintori, wife of jailed opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez.
But the government-allied National Electoral Council (CNE) on Thursday stopped the petition process, claiming the first stage in which MUD collected 1.85 million signatures in June - nearly 10 times the number required - had been tainted by fraud.

The first blast - in Ryazan, which lies 200 kilometres south-east of Moscow - destroyed the ninth and 10th storeys of an apartment building, blowing the top right off, according to a statement by the civil protection service.
Authorities said they believed the blast was a result of technical problems.

Kucinskis dismisses concerns that CETA might not benefit Latvia RIGA, Oct 24 (LETA) - Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis (Greens/Farmers) has dismissed concerns that Latvia will not benefit from the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between the European Union (EU) and Canada.
The prime minister told the press today that the free-trade agreement will certainly benefit Latvia.
"If there is the agreement, these issues are solved in a much more civilized manner and opportunities are much broader," Kucinskis said.
An arrival of Canadian companies in Latvia would not be anything bad either, because this would mean an influx of investment, the prime minister said.
"Such agreements are not irresponsible - each point is negotiated and the agreement is not concluded before the countries have reached their compromises.
The EU has warned that the EU-Canada summit, which is slated for this Thursday, will be cancelled if Belgium fails to approve CETA.
Talks on CETA were completed already in 2014, but its adoption has been delayed amid growing opposition to the agreement in Europe.
Opponents claim that CETA would give excessive powers to multinational companies and threaten the EU's environmental and consumer protection standards.
Two years back, Ashers Baking Company received an order from gay rights activist Gareth Lee for a cake featuring Bert and Ernie from Sesame Street, the slogan "support gay marriage" and a logo of the Belfast-based campaigning group QueerSpace.
"This order was at odds with our beliefs, it certainly was a contradiction of what the Bible teaches," Daniel McArthur, the general manager of the bakery in Belfast, Northern Ireland, said at the time.
The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland took the bakery to court for discrimination on the grounds of political and sexual orientation.
Northern Ireland is the only region in the United Kingdom where gay marriage has not been legalized.
Russia might be shipping nuclear-capable cruise missiles to the Baltics - experts WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (LETA) - Ship movements in the Mediterranean and the North Sea and comments posted online suggest that two Russian warships armed with long-range, nuclear-capable Kalibr cruise missiles are sailing to the Baltic Sea despite official statements to the contrary, said experts of the Atlantic Council think tank.
They both entered into service with the Black Sea Fleet at the end of last year.
In August they were deployed in the eastern Mediterranean, where they fired their main weaponry for the first time at targets in Syria.
However, naval blog site 7fbtk.blogspot.com challenged that account, quoting a September 16 statement from the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense as saying that the two ships were due to be transferred to the Baltic.
Reports from Ukrainian intelligence, blogs and the media of various countries point in the same direction. It appears, at the very least, highly likely that they are heading to the Baltic.

The EU and Canada are expected to ink the agreement at their summit on October 27.
Talks on CETA were completed already in 2014, but its adoption has been delayed amid growing opposition to the agreement in Europe.
Opponents claim that CETA would give excessive powers to multinational companies and threaten the EU's environmental and consumer protection standards.

They are among the Russian Navy’s newest vessels: both entered into service with the Black Sea Fleet at the end of last year, and were home-ported in Sevastopol.
On 19 August, while steaming in the eastern Mediterranean, they fired their main weaponry for the first time in anger, launching three cruise missiles at targets in Syria.
The Russian Ministry of Defense published video of the launches.
But the blogger revived it, quoting open sources as saying that the ships were expected in Malta in mid-October, and added, “Having travelled that far west with a tug, it seems even more likely that Serpukhov and Zelenyy Dol will continue to the Baltic Sea.
While Kalibr-capable ships and submarines are tested in the Baltic Sea before being transferred to the Black Sea Fleet, the Baltic Fleet currently has no Kalibr-capable ships or submarines in its own permanent inventory.” Away from Syria Sure enough, on 9 October, ship-spotters in Valletta, Malta, posted images of the two ships, together with a tug known as SB-36, moored in the Grand Harbor.
And the sdelanounas.ru website once again reported their arrival, and again commented that they are “currently making a transfer” to the Baltic Fleet.
The apparent answer came two days later, in a BBC report on the moves of the Kuznetsov group.
The BBC did not name the corvettes, but the only Russian corvettes reported in those waters were the Zelenyy Dol and Serpukhov.
Russian officials’ and news agency statements that the ships are to be based in the Mediterranean would appear at best inaccurate, and at worst, deceptive.

Also, a family with two adults and two children up to the age of 14 can be called poor if the family's monthly income is EUR 612.
The poverty risk group includes pensioners as 70 percent of pensioners in Latvia receive less than EUR 300 in monthly pension, also disabled people, single women, single parents with children, long-term unemployed people.

If a person can not afford to pay for at least two of these gods or services, the person of household is subjected to economic pressure.
Balga said that a situation with people living in such poverty almost does not exist in Luxembourg, Sweden, Finland and Denmark.
There is, however, even worse situation in Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria.

The Finance Ministry believes that one of the ways to reduce poverty would be progressive personal income tax.
Proposals for this tax will be prepared until April next year. The Welfare Ministry proposes a much simpler solution - the minimum wage.

Shipping nuclear-capable cruise missiles to the Baltic is a psychological scare tactic - Defense Ministry RIGA, Oct 25 (LETA) - Shipping nuclear-capable cruise missiles to the Baltic Sea is a psychological scare tactic being used by Russia, LETA was informed by Defense Ministry spokesman Kaspars Galkins.

In August they were deployed in the eastern Mediterranean, where they fired their main weaponry for the first time at targets in Syria.

Russia criticises US troop plans in Norway Oslo, Oct 26, 2016 (AFP) - Russia has criticised plans to deploy more than 300 American troops in Norway, saying it would do nothing to make northern Europe safer.
Norway announced Monday that 330 US Marines, to be stationed on rotation around 1,000 kilometres (600 miles) from the Russian border, will be engaged in training and manoeuvres from January 2017.
The American troops are to be based at Vaernes airport, which is close to Trondheim.
Norway, which admits its dependance on NATO to defend its territory, says the deployment is test run to be evaluated during 2017.
Australia bracing for foreign fighters returning from Iraq, Syria Sydney (dpa) - Australian authorities are preparing for an influx of foreign fighters returning from Syria and Iraq who could pose a threat to the community, a government minister said Wednesday.
As the Islamic State terrorist organization continues to suffer military defeats in Syria and Iraq "its modus operandi will change... to being an underground terrorist organization," Australian Justice Minister Michael Keenan said in Sydney.
Those who were not killed would seek to return to their country of origin and continue their struggle, he said, adding that they would include "a number of Australians" with "lengthy military experience" and "a deepened commitment to the Islamic State cause ."
"We must be ready with strategies to protect the safety of our communities and the welfare of children," Keenan said in his speech at the Lowy Institute, an Australian think-tank.
Denuclearizing N. Korea a'lost cause, 'US intel chief says Washington, Oct 26, 2016 (AFP) - Convincing North Korea to abandon nuclear weapons is a "lost cause," America's top intelligence official said Tuesday, causing concern in the State Department and ally South Korea over an issue of long-standing US policy.
The United States has always maintained it can not accept North Korea as a nuclear state and, under President Barack Obama, has made any talks with the North conditional on Pyongyang first making some tangible commitment towards denuclearisation.
"The notion of getting the North Koreans to denuclearize is probably a lost cause.
That is their ticket to survival," Clapper said.
"They are under siege, and they are very paranoid.
State Department spokesman John Kirby rebuffed Clapper's position, stressing that "nothing has changed" with the Obama administration's policy of pushing the North -- through a toughened sanction regime -- to give up its nuclear weapons.
"We want to continue to see a verifiable denuclearization of the (Korean) peninsula," Kirby said.
"The determination of not only South Korea and the US but of the international community to end North Korea's nuclear program is stronger than ever," a foreign ministry official told AFP.
"We will work with the international community to impose stronger sanctions and pressure on the North so it will have no other choice but to denuclearize," the official said.
Although there is no official dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang, there are regular, so-called Track 2 discussions involving former US diplomats and North Korean officials -- most recently in Malaysia last weekend.
Council members are currently debating a fresh resolution after the North's fifth nuclear test in September.
Turkey says determined to clear Syrian Kurd fighters from Manbij Ankara, Oct 26, 2016 (AFP) - President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday that Turkey was determined to clear Syrian Kurdish fighters from a strategic border town in northern Syria "as soon as possible".

"They will have to get out, leave and go beyond the Euphrates.
If they do not go, we will do what is required," he told a group of neighbourhood chiefs in Ankara.
Ankara views the PYD and the YPG (People's Protection Units) as terror groups linked to Turkey's outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
Turkey wants to stop the creation of an autonomous Kurdish "canton" in northern Syria.

The guys once again showed today what they have in them," said Lotte coach Ismail Atalan, whose team upset Bundesliga side Werder Bremen in the first round.
Vicenzo Grifo pulled a goal back in the 76th and Nils Petersen converted a penalty in the 82nd minute after a questionable ruling by the referee to even the game 3-3.

"And then a penalty shootout is always a 50-50 thing ."
The second round will finish off on Wednesday with nine Bundesliga clubs in action including Bayern Munich, who host Augsburg; and Borussia Dortmund, who welcome Union Berlin.
Mediterranean migrant deaths in 2016 hit record 3,800: UN Geneva, Oct 26, 2016 (AFP) - At least 3,800 migrants and refugees have perished this year while trying to cross the Mediterranean to reach Europe, the highest ever toll ever on the perilous route, the UN said Wednesday.
"We can confirm that at least 3,800 people have been reported dead or missing in the Mediterranean Sea so far this year, making the death toll in 2016 the highest ever recorded," UN refugee agency spokesman William Spindler told AFP in an email, as the figures passed last year's mark of 3,771.
Last year, more than a million people reached Europe via the Mediterranean, but crossings so far this year remain below 330,000.
The most dangerous route has been between Libya and Italy, where the United Nations has recorded one death for every 47 arrivals this year.
US, UK expect Raqa offensive in next few weeks Brussels, Oct 26, 2016 (AFP) - The offensive to drive the Islamic State group from its Raqa stronghold in Syria will begin in the next few weeks, top US and British defence officials said Wednesday.

Arriving for the two-day NATO defence ministers meeting in the Belgian capital, Fallon said: "We hope a similar operation will begin towards Raqa in the next few weeks ."
Carter said the idea of simultaneous operations against Mosul and Raqa "has been part of our planning for quite a while ."

Israeli soldier wounded by gunfire on Lebanese border: army Jerusalem, Oct 26, 2016 (AFP) - Gunfire from a vehicle in Lebanon towards Israeli forces on the border wounded an Israeli soldier on Wednesday and officers returned fire, the army said.
The army said later that "fire was exchanged between the vehicle" and Israeli forces in the incident near the Israeli town of Metula.
A source close to Lebanon's powerful Shiite militant group Hezbollah also told AFP "there were no shots fired from the Lebanese side of the border ."
The UN peacekeeping force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, said it had received Israel's report of the incident and that an investigation had been opened.
Lebanon and Israel are still officially at war although the border area has been relatively calm in recent years.
A 34-day conflict in 2006 led to the deaths of 1,200 people in Lebanon, mainly civilians, and 160 Israelis, mostly soldiers.
Recently, Hezbollah's focus has been on the war in Syria, where it has sent thousands of fighters to support President Bashar al-Assad's regime. burs-mjs/kir
In an interview focused largely on foreign policy, Trump said defeating Islamic State is a higher priority than persuading Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, playing down a long-held goal of U.S. policy.
On Syria's civil war, Trump said Clinton could drag the United States into a world war with a more aggressive posture toward resolving the conflict.
Clinton has called for the establishment of a no-fly zone and “safe zones” on the ground to protect non-combatants.
"You’re going to end up in World War Three over Syria if we listen to Hillary Clinton.
Clinton's campaign dismissed the criticism, noting that both Republican and Democratic national security experts have denounced Trump as unfit to be commander-in-chief.
"That battalion will be defensive in nature, but it will be fully combat-capable," Fallon said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.
The U.K. troops will deploy in the spring and will be joined in Estonia by forces from France and Denmark, he said.
The U.S. is also sending a force of 330 Marines to a base in Norway, a deployment approved Monday by the Norwegian government.
"We expect a sustained challenge from the East, from Russia, by way of its military activities," said Douglas Lute, the U.S. ambassador to NATO.
In Brussels this week, NATO defense ministers are expected to also discuss stepped-up coordination with the European Union, as well as French-German proposals to build up European defense capabilities.
Britain and Eastern European countries have opposed a move for the EU to create any sort of common army units or a military headquarters.
European defense officials said the current plans would focus on a small civilian military planning group to oversee African operations - an initiative that would n't replicate NATO's military branch, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe.
"Although we are leaving the European Union, we remain committed to European security.
This is our continent and we will keep on working to help keep it safe," he said.
"Tonight left a bad taste in everybody's mouth," Rose said, saying the team needed to learn to foul tactically.
"We've got to put people down.
"Little things like that, we just have to learn ."
Knicks star Carmelo Anthony believes the team will learn from its mistakes.
"I think more of our focus should be on defense now rather than offense," Anthony said.
"We've just got ta figure out who we want to be defensively as a team.
Three men disguised as "horror clowns" assaulted a 19-year-old man with a baseball bat at the weekend in the western state of Tirol, local police said on Tuesday.
The suspects fled the scene.
In another incident, a 16-year-old jogger was seriously injured on Sunday when she fell down a steep hill after being scared by a creepy clown who had jumped in her path in the Carinthian city of Villach.
Another 16-year-old girl twisted her ankle on Monday evening when she ran away from a man wearing a clown mask in a parking lot and fell down some stairs in central Styria.
Authorities said they were still searching for leads regarding the suspect.
"If you scare someone, you could be already committing an offence," Carinthian police spokesman Michael Masaniger said last week.
fights Hamburg (dpa) - Wladimir Klitschko says he plans "a few big spectacular fights" still and dismisses talk of retirement from the ring although he will be 41 next year.
But the Hamburg-based Ukrainian said he planned to box on, pointing out that his brother Vitali fought until 41 and only then retired to take up a political career.
"As long as I can perform in the ring, am healthy and motivated, I will continue ."
The incidents range from sightings of people dressed in clown outfits to clowns with horror masks frightening passersby to attempted and actual attacks on people with knives or other weapons, including baseball bats and chain saws, police and court authorities said.
The largest number of creepy clown attacks has been reported in the western German cities such as Duisburg, Cologne and Aachen where people have apparently picked up on the craze, which was originally promoted over social media in the United States.
In another twist in the series of incidents, a 16-year-old boy with clown mask had to undergo an emergency operation on Monday in Berlin after he was stabbed by a 14-year-old he had attempted frighten.
While police have warned that the number of attacks could increase in the run-up to Halloween at the end of the month, circus operators and clowns themselves have expressed concerns about the damage the attacks are causing to the traditional fun-loving image of clowns.

In August, a Doctors Without Borders boat was shot at by unidentified aggressors, but no-one was hurt.
"Because of some incidents that occurred in the past, I have already expressed concern about the security of the vessels deployed in the context of search and rescue operations," Frontex Director Fabrice Leggeri said in a press conference in Rome.
He said rescuers have to sail further out, "in some cases [until they are] just about to enter Libyan waters," as traffickers "do n't give sufficient petrol, food or water to the migrants so it is impossible for the migrants to reach Italy or to reach any European island ."
Russia's request to allow its ships to stop on Spanish territory "are under review" while Spain weighs input from its allies and Russian authorities, a foreign ministry spokesman told daily newspaper El Pais late Tuesday.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg expressed concern Tuesday that the flotilla could take part in Syria air strikes.
"It is up to each country to decide if these ships can refuel in different ports en route to the eastern Mediterranean," he said.
"I think all NATO members are aware that this group could be used to carry out air attacks on Aleppo and Syria," he added. Britain was more direct.
"Her Majesty's government has previously expressed concerns to the Spanish government about its hospitality to the Russian navy when we have concerns about Russia's military activity," a British government spokesman said.
"Access to Spanish ports is a matter for the Spanish authorities," he added.
He said that in his opinion Merkel’s migrant policy had been "criminal" and had provided an unrestrained influx of migrants which put the whole of Europe at risk.
Strache said: "She is the most dangerous politician in Europe.
With her welcoming policy she opened the door for Islamists, poor immigrants and soldiers of fortune, whose worldview does not fit into modern Europe ."
He said that the move had been "pre-programmed" to fail and added that he would not even rule out civil war in Europe as a consequence.
He added: "There are people coming to us who do not even think about integrating.
Ethnic and cultural external immigration should never have been allowed to exceed a certain limit ."
Philipines' Duterte wants US troops out in two years Tokyo, Oct 26, 2016 (AFP) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said Wednesday he wants US troops out of his country in the next two years and is willing to scrap defence pacts with longtime ally Washington if necessary.
"I want, maybe in the next two years, my country free of the presence of foreign military troops," Duterte told an economic forum in Tokyo, in a clear reference to US forces.
"I want them out and if I have to revise or abrogate agreements, executive agreements, I will," he added.
The US, which once operated sprawling bases in the country, now has a small number of Special Forces on the southern island of Mindanao to aid in counter-terrorism operations.
Duterte has previously said he wants US troops out of Mindanao because their presence stokes tensions on the island where Islamic militants have waged a decades-long separatist insurgency.
of Canada trade talks breakthrough; By Helen Maguire, dpa Brussels (dpa) - European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker expressed confidence that there could be a breakthrough Wednesday in crisis talks to save an EU-Canada trade deal.
Belgium's federal government has so far failed to sway the country's French-speaking Wallonia region to support the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), which aims to ease the flow of goods between Canada and the European Union.
"As we speak, the summit tomorrow is still possible," European Council President Donald Tusk told EU lawmakers in the French city of Strasbourg, while Juncker said he was "hopeful" of reaching agreement Wednesday.
Belgian Foreign Minister Didier Reynders, who is also responsible for trade issues, held a new round of talks with representatives of the country's regional governments early Wednesday.
"No more" than one or two points remained open, he said ahead of the meeting, the Belga news agency reported.
Among other things, new proposals relating to agriculture were on the table, the agency wrote.
"I am hopeful that during the course of today there will be an agreement between the Belgian government and the Walloon government and the governments of other parts of the country," Juncker told the European Parliament.
"Daesh (Islamic State group) killed around 30 civilians, including children, after they were taken hostage," Ghor Governor Nasir Khazeh told AFP.
There has so far been no official claim of responsibility from the group.
Belgian politician says; By Helen Maguire, dpa Brussels (dpa) - It will not be possible for Canada and the European Union to sign their landmark free trade deal at a summit planned for this week, a regional Belgian leader said Wednesday, with last-ditch talks underway to resolve the country's deadlock over the agreement.
Belgium's federal government has so far failed to sway the country's French-speaking Wallonia region to support the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), which aims to lift trade barriers and ease the flow of goods between Canada and the European Union.
The deal, which took seven years to negotiate, is supposed to be signed by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and EU officials in Brussels on Thursday, but that requires all 28 EU member states to be on board.
Trudeau is not expected to fly to Brussels if the deal can not be signed.
Even if the Belgian difficulties were resolved Wednesday, several more steps were required before Canada and the EU can ink the accord, added Wallonia's Prime Minister, Paul Magnette.
Fears are rife in economically embattled Wallonia that CETA would weaken labour and environmental standards and threaten its farming industry.
Political rivalries between the region's Socialist leaders and the federal centre-right coalition are also thought to be at play.

The 54-year-old actor has over 50 films under his belt and still has producers queuing up to snag him for their forthcoming movies but he's convinced he would n't be where he is today if he had n't taken up the"beautiful" religion - a body of beliefs and practices created in 1954 by American science fiction author L. Ron Hubbard - three decades ago.
Tom was first introduced to the church by his first wife Mimi Rogers, whom he was married to from 1987 until 1990, while he was still trying to make it as a global star.
The bizarre sci-fi cult's founder Hubbard claimed that billions of extra-terrestrial beings were sent to Earth by Xenu - the dictator of the'Galactic Confederacy ', comprised of 26 stars and 76 planets including Earth - who gathered them around volcanoes and then destroyed the aliens with hydrogen bombs.
Kyrgyzstan government resigns after coalition collapses Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, Oct 26, 2016 (AFP) - The government of Kyrgyzstan resigned Wednesday after the president's party quit the ruling coalition, sparking fears the Central Asian country could plunge into instability, the presidency said.
President Almazbek Atambayev's Social Democratic Party left the four-party ruling coalition on Monday after its other members did not back constitutional reforms.

Putin slams as'hysteria 'claims of Russian meddling in US election Sochi, Russia, Oct 27, 2016 (AFP) - President Vladimir Putin on Thursday slammed as "hysteria" claims that Russia has attempted to interfere in the upcoming US presidential elections by hacking American political institutions.
Is the US some kind of banana republic?
The United States is a great power.
Please correct me if I'm wrong," Putin said to laughter in the audience.
Washington last week formally accused the Russian government of trying to "interfere" in the 2016 White House race by hacking US political institutions, charges the Kremlin has repeatedly dismissed.
Putin has vehemently dismissed the accusations, saying they are meant to distract American voters from domestic problems.
Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the incident could indicate that a US "cyber machine of destruction has started acting".
Russia has been accused of favouring Republican candidate Donald Trump -- who has praised Putin and called for better relations with Moscow -- over the more hawkish Clinton.
Member states will have until midnight (2200 GMT) on Friday to give their formal approval to the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) and all supporting documents, the sources say.
The hope is that, "after all procedures are concluded, we will be able to say that the EU is ready to sign the CETA agreement," one source adds.

Venezuela anti-Maduro protests: Policeman shot dead One policeman has been shot dead and dozens of people injured during anti-government protests in Venezuela.
Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to protest against President Nicolas Maduro's government.
In Miranda state, a police officer died and two others were injured, the government said, blaming opposition activists. Opposition leader Henrique Capriles is the governor of the state.
Police there confirmed the death but did not blame protesters.
Opposition leaders have called for a mass walk-out on Friday.
After the general strike, if the government continues to block the recall referendum process, the opposition threatened to march on the presidential palace - something it has not been allowed to do since a march there in 2002 started a short-lived coup against the former President, Hugo Chavez.
"The Russian Federation has nothing to do with this terrible tragedy, with this attack," foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, adding that Moscow demanded an immediate investigation.
Zakharova said claims that Russian and Syrian warplanes had conducted the deadly air strikes in Idlib on Wednesday were "a lie ."
The raids hit a school and the surrounding area, killing 22 children and six teachers, the United Nations children's agency UNICEF said.
Asked about the attack, Russia's UN ambassador Vitaly Churkin said earlier: "It's horrible, horrible.
I hope we were not involved ."

Football: Coming out not a problem for sports fans - poll London, Oct 26, 2016 (AFP) - Most sports fans in England, Wales and Scotland would have no problem if their club signed a gay player despite a top football official claiming that he would not encourage stars to declare their homosexuality.
Last week, Greg Clarke, chairman of the Football Association, told a House of Commons committee he would not encourage players to come out.
Clarke said he was "personally ashamed" there were players who did not feel "safe" to come out, and promised to "stamp down hard" on homophobic behaviour in the game.
However, British lawmaker Damian Collins, chairman of the Culture, Media and Sports Committee, told AFP that Clarke's attitude and that of the FA had to change.
"Homophobia is just as unacceptable as racism and the FA should be working with the clubs and also punishing them if they are unable to control their fans ."

Polish politician ‘commissioned attack on presidential plane’: report A German Federal Intelligence (BND) report published in a new book allegedly indicates that a senior Polish politician commissioned Russian general Jurij Desinov to carry out an attack on the Polish presidential plane in Smolensk in 2010, Polish weekly Gazeta Polska reports.
According to the report, “the Polish presidential plane had very high security requirements” and placing explosives with a remote detonator on the plane would be “impossible without engaging Polish forces”, Gazeta Polska said.
The conspiracy that changed the world” is premiering in Polish on November 7.
Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS) party, which came to power last year, has reopened a probe into the 10 April 2010 plane crash in Smolensk, western Russia, which saw the death of 96 people, including then-President Lech Kaczyñski.
Obama seeks more close cooperation from Turkey on IS group Washington, Oct 27, 2016 (AFP) - President Barack Obama on Wednesday spoke by phone with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, urging close cooperation in the fight against the Islamic State group, the White House said.
"Obama noted the need for close coordination between the United States and Turkey to build on these successes and to apply sustained pressure on ISIL in Syria to reduce threats to the United States, Turkey, and elsewhere," a statement said, using another name for the Jihadist group.
In addition, the US president called for more dialogue on what he called "the appropriate level and form of Turkey's participation in the Counter-ISIL Coalition's efforts in Iraq ."
Obama said he and Erdogan agreed on their "strong support for the territorial integrity of Iraq," the statement said.
Turkey's positioning of troops in northern Iraq and its insistence that it has a role in the Mosul offensive have led to sharp exchanges with the Iraqi government, creating a headache for Washington as it tries to keep both of its allies on-side.
Gunta Basko-Melbarde led the way for the Latvian club with 19 points and eight rebounds, followed by Aishah Sutherland with 14 points and eight rebounds.
Mariya Popova led the way for the Turkish club with 21 points and six rebounds, while Latvian national team forward Kristine Vitola scored four points, pulled down eight rebounds and blocked two shots for Galatasaray.
The top two teams in the group will advance to the tournament's next stage.
RIA cited the ministry as saying NATO had no reason to worry about the battle group and that the Russian air force had not flown any bombing runs in Aleppo for nine days.
Andrei Kelin, a senior Russian Foreign Ministry official, told RIA Stoltenberg's statement was unhelpful.

The pontiff said differences between men and women, and their union in the "divine creation" of marriage and family, were part of God's design.

Russia to destroy all of its chemical weapons by end of 2017 MOSCOW (AP) — A top Russian official says Russia will destroy all of its chemical weapons by the end of next year, a year earlier than previously announced.
Col.-Gen. Valery Kapashin, a military official in charge of storage and elimination of Russia's chemical stockpiles, told news agencies on Thursday that the remaining weapons will have been disposed of by December 2017.

Belgium reaches consensus on EU-Canada free trade deal: PM Brussels, Oct 27, 2016 (AFP) - Belgian political leaders have reached a consensus in support of the landmark EU-Canada trade deal, Prime Minister Charles Michel said Thursday, raising hopes it can be signed soon.
"An agreement" has been found, Michel said after the latest round of marathon negotiations aimed at winning over holdouts in Belgium's French-speaking communities who have held up the deal for the entire European Union.
"We have finally found an agreement among the Belgians that will now be submitted to European institutions and our European partners," Magnette said.
"Wallonia is extremely happy that our demands were heard," he added.
Angering Canada and European Union leaders who had conducted negotiations for seven years, Belgium had effectively blocked the deal, which must be endorsed by all 28 EU member states.
Football: Italy earthquake stops Serie A clash Milan, Oct 26, 2016 (AFP) - A Serie A fixture between Pescara and Atalanta was halted for several minutes when a strong earthquake struck central Italy on Wednesday.
Referee Marco Guida called a stop to the action in Pescara near the 30 minute mark but restarted the game approximately three minutes later when the tremors subsided.
Central Italy, including the capital Rome, was hit by at least two strong earthquakes on Wednesday evening.
The withdrawal takes effect one year after the letter is received.

"Souran is strategically important because its control brings the regime closer to the southern countryside of Idlib province, which is controlled by rebels," Rami Abdel-Rahman, the Observatory head, told dpa.
Souran is also crucial for the regime because it used to be its army's northern gateway to the city of Hama, the capital of the province of the same name.
The prize will be awarded to Nadia Murad and Lamia Haji Bashar during a session of the assembly in Strasbourg, France, the sources said shortly before the official announcement.
Bashar, who was just 16 when she was taken and is also from Kocho, witnessed family and friends being slaughtered by IS jihadists before being enslaved and sold.
After 20 months in captivity she escaped but then fell into the hands of an Iraqi hospital director who also abused and raped her and several other victims.
- Lived through a nightmare - In a final tragedy, Bashar suffered horrific burns to her face and lost her right eye when one of her friends stepped on a landmine following their flight from the hospital director.
UN investigators have said the IS assault on the Yazidis was a premeditated effort to exterminate an entire community -- crimes that amount to genocide.
In speeches and interviews, Murad has voiced deep frustration with the international community for abandoning her people in the hands of grotesquely violent criminals.
Past winners include Pakistani education campaigner Malala Yousafzai, late South African rights icon Nelson Mandela and Myanmar activist Aung San Suu Kyi.
Erdogan says Turkish military operation will target Raqa Ankara, Oct 27, 2016 (AFP) - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Thursday that the military operation supporting Syrian opposition fighters in northern Syria will target the IS-held city of Raqa. Erdogan said the rebels were now advancing on the important city of Al Bab to clear Islamic State group elements.
The US-led coalition against IS is likely to provide air support but Turkey opposes the involvement of any Syrian Kurdish militias.
Since August 24, Turkish tanks and special forces have been inside northern Syria providing support to opposition fighters in an ambitious operation to remove IS jihadists from the entire border area.
The Turkey-backed rebels comprise different Syrian opposition brigades rather than a single organised force, according to experts.
Ankara says the People's Protection Units (YPG) and Kurdish Democratic Union (PYD) are linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) waging an insurgency in Turkey since 1984.
In August the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a US-backed alliance of about 30,000 Kurdish and Arab fighters, captured Manbij from IS.
He later said he told US President Barack Obama in a telephone conversation on Wednesday that he opposed any YPG or PYD participation.
With food growing scarce, "civilians are being bombed by Syrian and Russian forces, and if they survive that, they will starve tomorrow," said O'Brien.
"Aleppo has essentially become a kill zone ."
Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin shot back, accusing O'Brien of making "arrogant remarks" and failing to recognize that Russia had declared a humanitarian pause that he maintained had been holding for eight days.
The ambassador blamed opposition rebels and Al-Qaeda-linked jihadists for the failure at the weekend of a UN plan to evacuate the wounded from Aleppo and charged that the UN official was not objectively presenting the facts.
"Please leave this kind of report to a novel that you might write one day," said Churkin.
Federal prosecutors say the teenager, identified only as Shaas al-M. in keeping with German privacy rules, also recruited at least one person to fight in Syria.
Prosecutors said in a statement Thursday that al-M. joined IS in his Syrian home village in mid-2013.
He underwent military training and performed guard duties for the group before leaving for Germany in mid-2015.
The suspect was arrested March 22 and charged last week with membership of a foreign terrorist organization and breaking arms control laws.
"We are exploring a new technological world, with Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence at the forefront, that will allow us to create new forms of entertainment and content we could n't have previously imagined," Fuller said in a statement.

Further details of the collaboration will be announced next year.
A 73-year-old man in the town of Tolentino died of a heart attack which was possibly triggered by shock caused by the event, making him the first indirect casualty of the earthquakes, local news agency ANSA reported, quoting local police.
The second of 5.9 magnitude followed little more than two hours later and a third of 4.6 magnitude came shortly before midnight.
"All in all, the information we have is not as catastrophic as one might have presumed" after such large shocks, the head of Italy's civil defence agency Fabrizio Curcio told reporters, indicating that" a few dozen" people suffered injuries.
Two or three were immediately hospitalized, while others checked themselves in in various states of distress, but nobody was in a critical condition.
Wednesday's temblors, which were felt in Rome and other places hundreds of kilometres away, had their epicentres close to where a 6-magnitude earthquake struck on August 24, flattening several towns, killing 298 people and leaving thousands homeless.
"The area of our town is really finished, it is an apocalyptic situation," Rinaldi added.
"For sure there will have been some collapses... it is really tough," he said, adding that rain and temporary power cuts were making it hard to check.
However, the announcement came too late for EU leaders and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to go ahead with a signing ceremony in Brussels on Thursday.
"An agreement" has been found in support of the deal, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel told a press conference after marathon talks to win over holdouts in Belgium's French-speaking community.
"If it materialises, it's excellent news," he said during a visit to Paris, adding he was "cautiously optimistic".
Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, hailed the "good news" from Michel as he tweeted that he would contact Trudeau "once all procedures are finalised for EU signing CETA ."
"Today's summit is cancelled.
For now, no new date has been set," a European source told AFP on condition of anonymity.
With no agreement in sight, Trudeau's office said overnight that he had postponed plans to travel to Brussels.
In almost a week of drawn-out talks, leaders of Wallonia, a 3.5 million-strong region south of Brussels, had demanded guarantees that CETA will not harm local farming and other interests.
Magnette had especially opposed terms of the deal intended to protect international investors which critics say could allow them to force governments to change laws against the wishes of the people.
EU sources told AFP the documents agreed by the Belgian politicians must be vetted by all 28 EU member states as well as the Wallon parliament and other Belgian government institutions.
Major demolition work begins in Calais'Jungle ': AFP Calais, France, Oct 27, 2016 (AFP) - Major work began Thursday in the "Jungle" migrant camp to tear down the remaining makeshift shelters in the squalid settlement in Calais in northern France.

Police detain drunk driver in Riga 10-times over the legal limit RIGA, Oct 26 (LETA) - Police in Riga last weekend detained a man who was heavily drunk behind the wheel, LETA found out from the State Police. The man was detained on Krustabaznica Street driving Volkswagen automobile.
When police detained the man (born 1966), it was determined that the alcohol in his system was 10-times above the legal limit.
If convicted, the man could face a 15-day prison sentence, a fine of between EUR 1,200 to 1,400, as well as have his drivers' license revoked for a period of four years.
''Russia is not isolated.
Russia should not be isolated.
Russia is our largest neighbor, and it is in NATO's interest not to isolate Russia.
We need to straighten out our ties with Russia," he said.
He pointed out that the more tense the situation is, the more important it is to maintain open political dialogue channels with Russia.
However, Stoltenberg emphasized that NATO will continue to react to Russia's activities in a careful and responsible way, and added that it is considerably more difficult to predict the development of events when compared to the Cold War era.
''We are not in a Cold War situation - back then two military blocs were in direct confrontation with one another.
The Warsaw Pact does not exist anymore, nor is Russia a member of the Soviet Union, meaning that there is no total confrontation like there was during the Cold War era.
However, the main challenge is the fact that the situation now has become less predictable, as the situation during the Cold War was more stable and thus more predictable.
At the time the two military blocs placed considerable forces on the borders of one another, but the situation now has become less predictable, meaning that NATO must raise its readiness and deal with the challenges facing the alliances from different directions," Stoltenberg explained.
Three Kazakh weightlifters lose Olympic gold medals from London 2012 Berlin (dpa) - Three weightlifters from Kazakhstan are to lose Olympic gold medals from London 2012 after reanalysis of samples returned positive for doping, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said Thursday.
Zulfiya Chinshanlo, Maiya Maneza and Svetlana Podobedova were among eight athletes named in the latest release by the IOC. The trio all tested positive for the steriod stanozolol with Chinshanlo also positive for oxandrolone.
The IOC has conducted more than 1,000 retests in recent months from the London Games and Beijing 2008, identifying 98 positive cases.
The case against Russian wrestler Besik Kudukhov, who won a silver medal, was dropped following his death in a car crash.
Let’s urgently tell the Maltese government that we do not want to be complicit in war crimes and demand they prohibit entry," Avaaz said.
"Malta should be acting to stop the slaughter, not making money from it. Let’s speak out now ."

It claims that since Russia seized Crimea, Russian warships visited Malta in 2014 and 2015.
Turkey orders detention of 73 air force pilots: state media Ankara, Oct 27, 2016 (AFP) - Turkish authorities ordered the detention of 73 air force pilots as part of the probe into the group blamed for July's failed coup, state media reported Thursday.
At least 45 had already been detained after police operations began Thursday across the country including the central Konya province and the capital Ankara, the official Anadolu news agency said.
The accusations listed in the warrants for the pilots include "violating the constitution", being part of "an armed rebellion against the Turkish Republic" as well as "acting on behalf of the (Gulen) organisation", Dogan news agency reported.
Last week, Turkish media said 47 military officers stationed at the base were detained for alleged links to the movement. Dogan reported 29 of the 47 officers were later placed under arrest.
In total, Turkey says it has investigated 82,000 people in connection with the coup bid.
The president of Iraq's autonomous region of Kurdistan, Massoud Barzani, said: "The Iraqi army, specifically the [elite] anti-terrorism forces, are the ones who will enter Mosul ."
Barzani was speaking at a joint press conference with Iraq's Shiite leader Ammar al-Hakim in the area of Khazer, east of Mosul.
Barzani's remarks were aimed at allaying Baghdad's concerns about the Kurds' territorial ambitions.
In mid-2014, the Kurdish Peshmerga forces seized some areas in northern Iraq, including the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, after Iraqi security forces collapsed in the face of a lightning attack by Islamic State in the area.
The Peshmerga have since been instrumental in battling Islamic State in Iraq. In recent months, ties have improved between Kurdistan and the central government in Baghdad.
A man in a high visibility jacket and helmet was videoed destroying it on Wednesday night.
Reporters claim the man said he wanted to auction the star off, to raise funds for the women who have accused Mr Trump of sexually assaulting them.
The former Apprentice presenter received the star in 2007.
It has previously been surrounded by a miniature wall in protest of his plan to build a wall between the US and Mexico.
Despite the damage done on Wednesday night, the star is unlikely to be removed. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce is in charge of the sidewalk.
Man shot dead after stabbing officer outside US embassy in Kenya Nairobi, Oct 27, 2016 (AFP) - A man was shot and killed by Kenyan police outside the US embassy in the capital Nairobi on Thursday after stabbing an officer with a knife, police said.
Otieno said the dead man had been walking towards the US embassy and was close to the public entrance to the visa section when he attempted to grab a gun from one of the officers.
A statement from the US embassy confirmed the "shooting incident", adding that "no embassy personnel were involved ."
The well-guarded US embassy in Nairobi is located opposite the main UN complex in Gigiri, an upmarket suburb in the city's north popular with expatriates.
"Given that not all EU member states are ready to sign the CETA, the EU-Canada summit will not start today as planned," an EU source said on condition of anonymity.
The Canadian delegation, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, would not fly to Brussels as planned, a spokesman said late Wednesday.
"Canada remains ready to sign this important agreement when Europe is ready," Alex Lawrence, the spokesman for Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland, told dpa.
Fears are rife in economically embattled Wallonia that CETA would weaken labour and environmental standards and threaten its farming industry.
Political rivalries between the region's Socialist leaders and the federal centre-right coalition are also thought to be at play.
"Just in the operations over the last week and a half associated with Mosul, we estimate they've probably killed about 800-900 Islamic State fighters," General Joseph Votel, who heads the US military's Central Command, said in an interview with AFP, speaking from an undisclosed location.
The offensive, which began 10 days ago, has so far been concentrated in towns and villages around Mosul, and resistance may get heavier as Iraqi forces break through IS defences and enter the city itself.
Votel cautioned it was hard to provide precise numbers as IS fighters move around the city and blend in with the local population.
IS has lost the ability to move in large convoys, making it more difficult to replace fighters if it loses them in significant numbers.
But the US-led coalition against IS has said that the jihadists can still travel in smaller groups.
The coalition has previously said that it "does not use a casualty count as a measure of effectiveness in the campaign to ultimately defeat (IS) in Iraq and Syria ."
EU approves new Syria sanctions, targets 10 top officials Brussels, Oct 27, 2016 (AFP) - The European Union on Thursday added 10 top Syrian officials to its sanctions blacklist for their role in the "violent repression" of the civilian population.
The European Council of member states said the new Syrian sanctions would hit those "responsible for the violent repression against the civilian population in Syria, benefiting from or supporting the regime, and/or being associated with such persons".
Another 69 entities are affected by asset freezes while the EU also has in place other sanctions against Syria as a whole, including arms and oil embargoes plus investment restrictions.
These broader measures were extended in May and run through to June 1 next year.
Ahead of a meeting of NATO defense ministers today, where EU and NATO cooperation is to be discussed, Stoltenberg emphasized that"a stronger Europe means a stronger NATO".
He said that NATO and the EU is working together closer than ever before, like, for example, in the Aegean Sea, where NATO supports Greece, and on the EU borders with Turkey as part of Frontex operations. He said that mutual efforts are taking place to liquidate human trafficking.
''We have launched the operation Sea Guardian - our new sea operation in the Mediterranean Sea, which at the same time will also support the EU operation Sofija," he said.
Dennis Schroder and the Hawks have come to terms on a four-year, $70-million contract extension, according to Marc Stein and Zach Lowe of ESPN.

Indeed, "making a buzz" appears to have been the main reason the former mayor introduced the ban, according to his son, Elie Jeune.
And the idea appeared to have worked, with journalists from all over the world coming to interview the mayor throughout the fifties.

France and UK trade blame over migrants left in'Jungle' Calais, France, Oct 28, 2016 (AFP) - Dozens of migrant youths stranded for two days in the Calais "Jungle" as it was being demolished were offered transfers out of the camp Friday as France and Britain battled over who was to blame for their plight.
Aid workers on Friday urged them to take buses leaving for shelters in another part of France.
On Thursday evening, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve reacted indignantly to a demand by his British counterpart Amber Rudd that children left in the Jungle are "properly protected ."
Cazeneuve expressed "surprise" at Rudd's call.
"These people... had been planning to migrate to the United Kingdom", he said in a statement, insisting that France "had fulfilled its responsibilities out of solidarity and without trying to shy away" from its duty.
Britain has taken in 274 others since mid-October and is examining hundreds of other applications.
Nearly 4,400 adults, mostly single men, have been moved to towns and villages around France.
"The state still has a serious obligation towards migrants who are minors ."
Most of the migrants in Calais hoped to reach Britain because they have contacts there, speak the language and believe their job prospects to be better than in France.
"To win the championship would be a childhood dream, of course, but that's it and that's where it ends for me.
I like to keep it simple, be in the moment and just do what I can focus on.

Venezuela president threatens to jail opponents Caracas, Oct 28, 2016 (AFP) - Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro threatened on Friday to jail his political opponents if they follow through on their vow of launching a legislative trial to remove him from power.
"If they launch a supposed political trial, which is not in our constitution, the state prosecution service must bring legal action in the courts and put in jail anyone who violates the constitution, even if they are members of congress," Maduro said in a public speech.
"It is my right and my duty as a politician to speak about the problems in our country," Wilders said in a statement, renewing accusations that it was "a political trial" and insisting, "I have said nothing wrong ."
When the crowd shouted back "Fewer!
"It is a travesty that I have to stand trial because I spoke about fewer Moroccans," Wilders said Friday.
"Millions of Dutch citizens (43 percent of the population) want fewer Moroccans," he claimed.
"Not because they despise all Moroccans or want all Moroccans out of the country, but because they are sick and tired of the nuisance and terror caused by so many Moroccans ."
"If speaking about this is punishable, then the Netherlands is no longer a free country.
But a dictatorship," he added.

John Lennon MBE return letter valued at £60k BBC A letter John Lennon wrote to the Queen explaining why he was returning his MBE was found tucked in a record sleeve from a £10 car boot haul.
The anonymous owner took the document to a valuation day at The Beatles Story in Liverpool on Wednesday - and discovered it was worth about £60,000.
One expert believes the text is a draft of the letter Lennon sent in 1969, which remains in the Royal archives.
Lennon, along with the other members of The Beatles, initially accepted the MBE when it was awarded in the Queen's 1965 birthday honours, but later returned it in 1969.
Officials alleged Akhtar had recruited the men to spy for him.
The Pakistani diplomat and his accomplices were found with forged documents, maps, deployment charts and lists of officers working at India's border with Pakistan.
"There was high probability that the information passed on by these anti-national elements to PIO (Pakistan Intelligence Operative) is being used against the national interests and could be highly detrimental to national security," Reuters news agency quoted Indian police as saying.
Pakistan's High Commission in New Delhi (pictured above) rejected the accusations, saying it "never engages in any activity that is incompatible with its diplomatic status ."
On Thursday, Islamabad announced it was declaring Indian diplomat Surjeet Singh persona non grata and had ordered him to leave the country within the next 48 hours.
Singh was accused of activities "in violation of the Vienna Convention and the established diplomatic norms," a statement by Pakistan's foreign ministry said.
Soon afterwards, India said it sent special forces to conduct "surgical strikes" to kill militants within Pakistani territory.
Pakistan has denied its frontiers were breached by Indian forces and has accused New Delhi of trying to shift attention from human rights violations in Kashmir.
Sweden refuses to suspend Assange's arrest warrant for funeral Stockholm, Oct 28, 2016 (AFP) - The Swedish prosecutor's office on Friday said it has rejected WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's request to temporarily suspend an arrest warrant so he could leave the Ecuadorian embassy in London and attend a funeral.
"Julian Assange has requested that the Swedish prosecutor should grant him leave from the detention order and the European arrest warrant in order to go to a funeral," the prosecutor's office said in a statement.
The prosecutor dismissed Assange's request, saying that Swedish law does not allow permission or exemption to a court decision on issuing of a European arrest warrant.
The prosecutor's office did not specify whose funeral Assange wanted to attend or where it would be held.
In September, a Swedish appeals court ruled against his request to lift the arrest warrant, the eighth straight time a Swedish court has ruled against him.

"Not just at an individual level, but above all on a collective level... he knows everything he is achieving is thanks to his hard work and the work of those around him ."
Ronaldo is expected to face competition from five-time winner Lionel Messi, Madrid teammate Gareth Bale and Atletico Madrid and France forward Antoine Griezmann for the award. However, his form has slumped since his return from a two-month injury layoff after suffering knee ligament damage in the Euro 2016 final.
"What Cristiano has done is raise the bar so high that every time he does n't score it is a problem," added Zidane.

The period refers to October 20 to 26 and related to several provinces, including Diyarbakir, which has been the scene of growing unrest after the authorities arrested the local Kurdish mayors on allegations of supporting terrorism.
Turkey has removed mayors from dozens of localities in the mostly Kurdish south-east and replaced them with trustees appointed by Ankara.

About 45 per cent of these cases were in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo.
If Russia continues its nuclear weapons rhetoric, NATO will have to review its strategy - Rasmussen RIGA, Oct 28 (LETA) - During today's annual high level security and foreign policy forum Riga Conference, former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said that if Russia continues its nuclear weapons rhetoric, NATO will also be forced to review its strategy on this matter.
The current activities in regards to nuclear weapons shows that the leadership in the Kremlin is more unpredictable than during the communist era, he said.
''But now we keep hearing more and more about these weapons, and I wonder why that is.
I truly hope that this is just rhetoric," he said.
However, if this is not just rhetoric, the former NATO secretary general said that the alliance would too have to review its nuclear strategy.
He said that the fact that the no candidate has been put through to the second round of the tender shows that they were not suitable candidates.
He also emphasized that the state has problems in selecting candidates for high level positions, as the salary matters must be dealt with, there are problems in the reputation of the state administration, and there is usually a political backdrop.
Delna has for quite a while been saying that Strelcenoks should not be heading the KNAB, as he is not suitable for this post.
We are not surprised at this decision, and it is an adequate one," Volberts told LETA.
As reported, none of the candidates competing for the post of the KNAB's head has been selected for the second round of the tender, State Chancellery director Martins Krievins, who chairs the panel assessing the candidates, told journalists today.
Altogether, ten applications were received in the tender, organized to pick Latvia's next anti-corruption chief.
Unofficial information suggest that other candidates included Kristaps Zakulis, a former head of the Financial and Capital Market Commission (FCMC), and Ilja Boronovskis, strategic planning head at the Internal Security Bureau.

FBI reopens probe into Clinton emails Washington, Oct 28, 2016 (AFP) - The FBI told US lawmakers Friday it has reopened its inquiry into emails sent by White House frontrunner Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state, after discovering new emails "that appear to be pertinent ."
FBI director James Comey said his agency would take "appropriate investigative steps" to decide whether a new batch of mails contained classified information, "as well as to assess their importance to the investigation ."
"We do n't agree with the one-sided interpretation made by the European Commission," Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski said in an interview with Polish radio.
Poland's foreign ministry called the commission's recommendations "groundless" in a statement late Thursday.
"We regret to note that the commission recommendation is an expression of incomplete knowledge about how the legal system and the Constitutional Tribunal operate in Poland," the ministry said.
Warsaw did not make public its response to the commission, which local media said spanned a dozen pages.
The Council of Europe, the continent's top human rights watchdog, and the European Parliament have also expressed their concerns and urged the government to backtrack on its reforms.
Warsaw has responded that it is not the EU's place to interfere in Polish internal affairs.
"It was a very active and tense evening as law enforcement worked through the evening to clear protesters," the department said.
The 1,172-mile (1,885-km) pipeline, being built by a group of companies led by Energy Transfer Partners LP, would offer the fastest and most direct route to bring Bakken shale oil from North Dakota to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries.
But the pipeline has drawn the ire of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and environmental activists who say it threatens the water supply and sacred tribal sites.
Reuters was unable to confirm the authenticity of the video, which showed a helicopter overhead as some protesters said police had used bean-bag guns in an effort to chase them out of the camp.
"I heard a voice telling me to stop swearing or the plane will crash in mid-air, and so I promised to stop," he told reporters at the airport.
Mr Duterte's blunt speaking, often directed at the West, has contributed to his popularity at home. He called President Barack Obama a "son of a whore", called the European Union "hypocritical", threatened to leave the UN and accepted comparisons to Hitler, saying he would gladly kill three million drug addicts.
Mr Duterte said he had promised God he would not "express slang, cuss words and everything", and said a "promise to God is a promise to the Filipino people".
But he suggested his promise might have its limits.
Trump attacks Clinton on trade, says he should be handed victory TOLEDO, Ohio; WINSTON SALEM, N.C. U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump criticized Democrat Hillary Clinton on Thursday over her trade policies, saying she would handle trade deals so badly that the country should "just cancel the election" and name him the victor.
Speaking to supporters in Toledo, Ohio, Trump said the North American Free Trade Agreement signed by Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, had led to the outsourcing of thousands of Ohio jobs to Mexico, a practice he vowed to stop if elected president on Nov. 8.
"We should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump, right ?"

IS kills hundreds, kidnaps thousands around Mosul: UN Geneva, Oct 28, 2016 (AFP) - Islamic State fighters have killed more than 250 people and kidnapped nearly 8,000 families around Mosul in recent days as Iraqi troops advanced on the northern city, the United Nations said Friday.
UN rights office spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told reporters in Geneva that the jihadists are forcing civilians living in districts around Mosul into the city, hoping to use them as human shields in an upcoming battle.
Shamdasani said Friday that the fresh allegations had been "corroborated", but may not reflect the full toll as there were likely other atrocities that have gone unreported.
"Credible reports suggest that ISIL has been forcing tens of thousands of people from their homes in sub-districts around Mosul," said Shamdasani, using another acronym for IS.
The offensive, launched on October 17, has seen tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers advancing on the city from the south, east and north.
"There is absolutely no reason why we should close off any options," he later told BBC radio.
"We are entitled to carry on scrutinising, and, yes, if necessary, to change our minds.
This is not about an elite overruling the people.
"If it becomes clear that this is either a deal that does n't make it worth our while leaving; or, alternatively, a deal that is going to be so serious in its implications that people decide they do n't want to go, there's got to be some way, either through parliament, or through an election; possibly through another referendum," he added.
He pointed out to conference participants that almost 70 years after the formation of the European Union, its residents have become complacent, as the generation which experiences the world wars are not with us anymore.
However, he reminded that security today is not like it once was, and that the world is facing a variety of serious security challenges.
These challenges have gone farther than areas bordering Europe, which the conflict in Syria shows.
''We have seen that military exercises near Ukraine and Georgia can turn into aggression, occupation and annexation," the president said.
At the same time, he emphasized that Russia is a country which sees the West and its values as an enemy.
Highlighting the importance to NATO and the EU, Vejonis emphasized that these two alliances have brought peace and stability to Europe, and that membership of these two organizations is a substantial benefit to all.
Meanwhile, Defense Minister Raimonds Bergmanis (Greens/Farmers) emphasized that NATO has shown its ability to adapt to new strategic challenges, and that this must continue without collapsing to some sudden shock.
The conference has gathered over 600 high-level foreign security and foreign policy experts, diplomats, politicians, academics, business representatives, as well as media representatives.
The main topics on the agenda at this year's conference will be the EU's role in the global economy, the impact of Brexit on the EU's future, NATO and its ability to adapt to 21st century challenges, as well as the West's relations with Russia and the challenges facing the Eastern Partnership initiative countries.
The near miss occurred late on October 17, when a Russian jet that was escorting a larger spy plane manoeuvred in the vicinity of an American warplane, Air Force Lieutenant General Jeff Harrigian said.
The Russian jet came to "inside of half a mile", he added.
Another US military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the American pilot could feel the turbulence produced by the Russian jet's engines.
The Pentagon periodically chides Russia for "unsafe and unprofessional behaviour" in air operations.
This incident was deemed unsafe, but not necessarily unprofessional, officials said. wat/srm
Earlier on Thursday, the government said it was postponing peace talks with the ELN rebels until they release an ex-lawmaker held hostage, just hours from the scheduled start of negotiations.
The rebels later began the process of releasing the hostage, Odin Sanchez, the government's chief negotiator in the talks said, adding that the process could take until next week.
The National Liberation Army (ELN) is Colombia's second largest rebel group, after the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which has been in talks with the government for nearly four years.
The ELN talks are meant to open a new, decisive front in President Juan Manuel Santos's efforts to end an armed conflict of half a century that has killed more than 260,000 people.
Santos, the winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize, has already signed a peace deal with the FARC, but voters rejected it in a referendum this month -- sending negotiators back to the drawing board.
Russia picked up 112 votes, while Croatia won 114 and Hungary 144.
The three countries were competing for two regional seats.
Human Rights Watch had warned that the return of Russia and also of Saudi Arabia risked weakening the council in its work to hold abusers to account.
Saudi Arabia, which was re-elected with 152 votes, was almost guaranteed to retain its seat as part of a clean slate of four countries vying for four regional seats.
Croatia, Iraq and Rwanda were elected for the first time.
The other elected members were Brazil, Britain, Japan, South Africa, Tunisia and the United States. cml/oh
EU's Georgieva resigns to join World Bank: statement Brussels, Oct 28, 2016 (AFP) - EU Budget Commissioner and vice president Kristalina Georgieva of Bulgaria has resigned from her job in Brussels to become chief executive officer of the World Bank, a statement said Friday.
"It is with great regret that I have accepted Kristalina Georgieva's decision to resign from the European Commission," Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said.
Georgieva, a former World Bank vice president, had been in the running for the new secretary general of the United Nations, which was given to Antonio Guterres, a former Portuguese prime minister.
Mass arrest as North Dakota police, pipeline protesters clash Chicago, Oct 28, 2016 (AFP) - Police in the US state of North Dakota arrested oil-pipeline protesters en masse Thursday after a tense standoff and bursts of violence that continued into the night.
One person was shot in the hand after being "run off the road by protestors," said the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services.
"The police action today was to remove protectors from this land," he said.
The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose reservation is close to the pipeline's route, objects to the project, saying it would endanger the tribe's water supply by crossing the nearby Missouri River, and destroy sacred Native American sites.
The tribe has asked the Obama administration to intervene to stop the pipeline construction and for the Justice Department to oversee local law enforcement.
The federal government has twice asked the pipeline operator to voluntarily pause construction near the tribe's reservation while the authorities reconsider the project's route.
UN says IS slaughtered at least 232 people near Mosul last week Geneva, Oct 28, 2016 (AFP) - Islamic State group fighters killed at least 232 people in and around Mosul last week as Iraqi troops advanced on the city, the UN rights office said Friday.

Syria rebels launch assault to break Aleppo siege Aleppo, Syria, Oct 28, 2016 (AFP) - Syrian opposition fighters on Friday launched a major assault on government forces to break a months-long siege of rebel-held neighbourhoods of the battered city of Aleppo.
The rebels also targeted government positions east of Aleppo city and in the coastal province of Latakia, including the Hmeimim military base that is used by Russian forces allied with the regime.
Rebel groups "announce the start of the battle to break the siege of Aleppo," said Abu Yusef Muhajir, a military commander and spokesman for Ahrar al-Sham.
The assault "will end the regime occupation of western Aleppo and break the siege on the people trapped inside," he told AFP.
- 'A kill zone '- Syrian state television reported the assault, saying "the army has foiled an attempt by terrorists to attack Aleppo city from several axes with suicide bomb attacks and has inflicted losses on them ."
"Terrorist groups have made no advances and clashes are continuing," it added.
State news agency SANA said government planes were carrying out airstrikes south and west of Aleppo.

Poland denounces Russian nuclear-capable warships in Baltic Warsaw, Oct 28, 2016 (AFP) - NATO member Poland on Friday denounced as "aggressive and irresponsible" Russia's fresh deployment of two warships in the Baltic Sea capable of launching long-range nuclear warheads.
"The deployment of ships that can also carry nuclear weapons is an aggressive and irresponsible behaviour, and an inappropriate reaction to the decisions that NATO took in July in Warsaw," Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski told public broadcaster Polish Radio.
Since then, the Kremlin has stepped up its presence in the Baltic Sea area and its jets frequently test the airspace of NATO allies such as Estonia.
"We can confirm that two Russian warships have recently entered the Baltic Sea. NATO navies are monitoring this activity near our borders," Dylan White, acting NATO spokesman told AFP on Wednesday.
"Russia has the right to operate in international waters," he said but added: "At the same time, there is a pattern of increased Russian military activity near our borders ."

Legal challenge to Brexit dismissed by Northern Irish court London (dpa) - A court in Northern Ireland Friday dismissed the first legal challenge to Britain's plans to leave the European Union without parliamentary approval.
Lawyers for a group of plaintiffs, led by investment fund manager Gina Miller, had said Prime Minister Theresa May did not have the authority to use an ancient legal privilege to justify her decision to start Brexit negotiations without a parliamentary vote.
The British government insists it has such an authority under its prerogative powers, which grant legal privilege to the government on behalf of the sovereign.
North Dakota police arrest pipeline protesters Chicago, Oct 28, 2016 (AFP) - Police in the US state of North Dakota engaged in a tense standoff with oil-pipeline protesters Thursday in an effort to clear them from a public road and off private property.
One person was shot in the hand after being "run off the road by protestors," and a woman narrowly missed a sheriff's deputy after firing three shots at police as she was being arrested, the emergency office said.
Demonstrators moved to block two roads over the weekend, camping on private land in an effort to stop Energy Transfer Partners' construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline -- the subject of a months-long protest by Native Americans and supporters.
The project resumed construction earlier this month after courts refused to halt it.
Most protesters left voluntarily or were arrested, officials said.
The tribe had asked the Obama administration to intervene to stop the pipeline construction and for the Justice Department to oversee local law enforcement.
The federal government has twice asked the pipeline operator to voluntarily pause construction near the tribe's reservation while the authorities reconsider the project's route.
Turkey urges end to NATO mission in Aegean by end of year Istanbul, Oct 28, 2016 (AFP) - Turkish Defence Minister Fikri Isik called for the NATO migrant mission in the Aegean Sea to be completed "by the end of the year" because it had "reached its goal".
"For us there is no need for NATO forces in the Aegean," Isik told reporters on Thursday after a meeting in Brussels with defence ministers from NATO member states.
"This was a temporary mission, and the goal has been reached... There is no reason to extend it," Isik was quoted as saying by the official news agency Anadolu.
Isik said Turkey would remain committed to tackling the flow of migrants and asked that the NATO mission be brought to an end "by the end of this year".
NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg praised the mission, saying it had "decreased substantially" the flow of migrants and was "making a difference".
However, thousands of migrants have continued taking the more dangerous central Mediterranean route from Libya to Italy, over 5,000 of whom have died at sea.
It would be the first time Japan, the only country that has ever come under nuclear attack, has clinched such a deal with a non-member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
The pact includes a provision to ensure the two countries will not use Japanese nuclear power plant technology for military purposes, the Kyodo News agency reported, citing unnamed Japanese diplomatic sources.
The two leaders are also expected to discuss defence cooperation, which includes joint maritime exercises between Japan, India and the United States, and agree on the importance of the rule of law at sea in light of Beijing's expansionary activities in the East and South China seas and the Indian Ocean, the report said.
Yemen's Houthis launch missile toward Saudi holy city Yemen's Houthi militia launched a ballistic missile toward Mecca on Thursday, the Saudi-led coalition intervening in Yemen's civil war said on Saudi state news agency SPA.
Coalition forces destroyed the missile 65 km (40 miles) from the holy city without damage and retaliated against the launch site inside Yemen, the statement said.
The Houthis confirmed the launch of a Burkan-1 ballistic missile into Saudi Arabia in a statement to their official news agency on Friday but said it targeted King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, the kingdom's busiest airport.
[Join a Yahoo Daily Fantasy Basketball contest now | Free NBA Yahoo Cup entry] The Indianapolis Star’s Dana Hunsinger Benbow recently caught up with Oden, the former Indiana Mr. Basketball and 7-foot phenom once touted as the sport’s next great big man.

It’s over.” Instead, he is back with the Buckeyes as a student coach, helping out the players and Matta any way he can.
Oden faced trial on felony battery charges in connection with that incident, after which Oden reportedly told police, “I was wrong and I know what has to happen.” He reached a plea agreement in the case, pleading guilty to battery with moderate bodily injury.

Syrians in Germany say many of the country's Arab mosques are more conservative than those at home.
Over two months, a dozen Syrians in six places of worship in three cities told Reuters they were uncomfortable with very conservative messages in Arabic-speaking mosques.
In Germany, other different faiths are traditionally supported by the state. But most of the country's four million Muslims originally came from Turkey and attend Turkish-speaking mosques which are partly funded by Ankara.
Last year around 890,000 asylum-seekers, more than 70 percent of them Muslims, entered the country.
Around a third came from Syria.
Many of them do not want to go to Turkish mosques because they do not understand the sermons. They prefer to worship where people speak Arabic.?
Yet in these mosques, other problems arise. They are often short of funds, or else supported by Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states.
"Unfortunately it is true that a large majority of Arabic-speaking mosques are more conservative than Turkish mosques," said Professor Mouhannad Khorchide, who heads the Centre for Islamic Theology at Muenster University.
We can not rule out permanent bases in eastern Europe if Russia becomes more aggressive - former NATO secretary-general RIGA, Oct 28 (LETA) - Former Secretary General of NATO Anders Fogh Rasmussen said at the annual Riga Conference today that if Russia's aggression continues, NATO would have to open permanent military bases in eastern Europe.
Rasmussen said that the decisions by NATO to enhance the alliance's presence in the Baltic region were very important and correct, but he did not rule out the possibility that if Russia continues to provoke other countries, this military presence would have to be enhanced even more.
''I do not rule out that permanent bases will be necessary in some countries, so that the alliance would be able to quickly react in case of an attack on a NATO ally," Rasmussen said.
At the same time, he expressed bewilderment on the national position of some European Union countries regarding support for the Baltic region.
He said that he does not understand why Germany, France and Italy have a view that such support is not necessary.
The former secretary-general reminded that the whole essence of NATO is reaction if one of its allies is under threat.
Rasmussen said that the United States continues to play a huge role in collective defense, and expressed hope that the United States will take a stronger position after the presidential election to lessen the power of autocratic regimes around the world.
At the same time, he reminded that members states must continue to invest in their own defense capabilities.
The main topics on the agenda at this year's conference will be the EU's role in the global economy, the impact of Brexit on the EU's future, NATO and its ability to adapt to 21st century challenges, as well as the West's relations with Russia and the challenges facing the Eastern Partnership initiative countries.

"We are not Arabs, we are our own Kurdish nation... At some point there will be a referendum on the independence of Kurdistan, and then we will let the people decide ."
In February, Kurdish president Massoud Barzani, the premier's uncle, had called for a referendum on a Kurdish state in northern Iraq, raising tension with Baghdad which opposes secession.

occurred in Rio Games anti-doping tests Montreal (dpa) - The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) accused the International Olympic Committee (IOC) of "serious failings" during the collection of athlete samples at this year's Rio Olympics.
The report, published Thursday by an independent observer team at the agency in Montreal, said Rio doping control personnel lacked crucial training, testing equipment was lacking and planning was "inadequate" at various times during the Games.
It said some of the failings in Rio were outside of organizers' control, while others were due to "budget and operational cutbacks ."
"Untrained and inexperienced chaperones should not be working at the Games," the report said.
"Despite staffing issues, resource constraints and other logistical difficulties, those tasked with implementation of the program, and in particular the volunteers, deserve immense credit," the chairman of the observer team, Jonathan Taylor, said in a WADA press release.
California State senator Kevin de Leon presented the 92-year-old with the plaque and called him one of the world's "greatest living entertainers".

Man who defaced Trump's Hollywood star arrested Los Angeles, Oct 27, 2016 (AFP) - A man who admitted to defacing Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in protest at the Republican presidential candidate's treatment of women was arrested on Thursday, police said.
James Otis had planned to hold a news conference in the early morning at the site of Trump's star and then surrender to police, but he was arrested beforehand.
Otis, who had his misdeed filmed on Wednesday, said he initially wanted to remove the star and auction it in New York on Election Day.
"When people are unhappy with one of our honorees, we would hope that they would project their anger in more positive ways than to vandalize a California state landmark," chamber head Leron Gubler said.
"Our democracy is based on respect for the law.
People can make a difference by voting and not destroying public property ." Gubler said the chamber planned to pursue the case against Otis, who was charged with one felony count of vandalism.
This is not the first time Trump's Walk of Fame star has been targeted.
- Europe's dwindling appeal - EU officials have admitted that Europe's appeal has dwindled in the ex-Soviet republic in spite of the 2014 association agreement.
"The fact that we have had successive governments that have called themselves pro-European (...) has taken a toll on the popularity of the European vector," Tapiola told AFP.
"What have we received from Europe?
Dodon, who served as economy minister from 2006 to 2009 under a Communist government, has pledged to "restore a strategic partnership with Russia" and to void the economic portion of the association agreement with the EU.
"I am not against the EU," Dodon told AFP, stressing that the implementation of reforms demanded by Brussels, including in the justice system, are in Moldova's interest.
Candidate Maia Sandu of the centre-right opposition, currently second in voting intention polls, has promised to make Moldova European.
"We advocate European integration because we see true democracy and prosperity for workers in the EU," Sandu told AFP.
Sandu, a former education minister who worked for the World Bank, conceded that authorities in Chisinau will have to convince "Moldovans and European partners of their sincerity" before even setting a timeline for the country's possible accession to the EU.
"Moldova needs to be part of the EU," said 66-year-old former construction worker Mihai Scutelnic.
"But before that we need to put our country in order ."
"It's better to have close ties with Russia because Europe does not need our commodities," he said.
Factory worker Vladimir, 37, said the country was "psychologically closer to Russia" because of its Soviet past.
"I think that some may have preferred to direct the discourse into pro-EU or pro-Russia because it is an easy discourse compared to the main discourse," he said.
"What are the reforms which are needed, what are we going to do with the justice system, how are we going to deal with corruption ?"

Bookies give about a 40% chance that MP Kaimins will be voted into next parliament RIGA, Oct 29 (LETA) - After several prominent party members left the KPV LV party, recently formed by the extravagant Latvian politician Artuss Kaimins, his chances of being elected into the next Saeima have fallen to about 40 percent, according to the bookmakers from Triobet.
The drop in the probability of the party being elected into the next Saeima is mostly due to several well-known party members leaving the party this week, including local hip-hop artist Armands Kincs, as well as the well-known whistle-blowing hacker who under the nickname Neo accessed the database of the Latvian State Revenue Service (VID) and leaked the stolen data to the press in 2010, Ilmars Poikans.

Up until now, Kaimins has preached transparency, responsibility and maintaining a connection with the public, however, the accusations revealed of what is happening behind the scenes at the party is in contradiction with these values.
As reported, four out of the nine KPV LV board members – Ilmars Poikans, Marita Eisaka, Uldis Neilands and Armands Kincs - have left KPV LV party as they had become disillusioned in the party's ideals and its leader.

Iceland votes in snap polls after Panama Papers scandal Reykjavik, Oct 29, 2016 (AFP) - Determined to put the Panama Papers scandal and the 2008 bankruptcy behind them, Icelanders will vote on Saturday in a snap election that could see the anti-establishment Pirate Party form a new centre-left coalition.
Although the current government of the conservative Independence Party and the centrist Progressive Party survived the scandal, it promised a snap election six months before the end of its term in spring 2017.
"We're loosing support (because of the) big anti-establishment (feeling)," Birgir Armannsson, member of parliament for the Independence Party, told AFP.

The results will be known shortly after polling stations close but because no party is expected to have a majority Iceland's fate will only be known after coalition negotiations.
If the Pirate Party does well, it could form the nation's second centre-left government since Iceland's independence from Denmark in 1944.

In any negotiations to form a government, the Pirate Party is expected to have leverage over the outgoing Independence Party and the leftist Green movement could for the first time hold the balance of power.

Three years ago, then Culture Minister Zaneta Jaunzeme-Grende (National Alliance) released the previous Latvian National Opera Director Andrejs Zagars.
"I will definitely not apply.
I believe that we will open the 2018/2019 season with a new production - the first Latvian national opera, Alfreds Kalnins' Banuta ."
Although he has halted Zagars' practice of demanding additional EUR 0.5 million from the state budget every year, "today I do not think anymore that this was a bad practice ."
But I'm actually not sure if that's the right way.
I also do not want to deny the Culture Ministry's contribution, which is trying to help us as much as possible, but sometimes I do feel that I should go ask more.
Honestly - I'm tired of being a good boy," says Liepins.

The DHC-4 Caribou was flying from Timika to Ilaga in Papua's central highlands when it lost contact around midnight on Sunday, said ministry spokesman Bambang Ervan.
He has refused to cooperate in what he calls "a political trial" and, as is his right under Dutch law, is leaving his defence to his lawyers.
Due to run until November 25, the trial particularly focuses on a comment made at a March 2014 local government election rally, when Wilders asked supporters whether they wanted "fewer or more Moroccans in your city and in the Netherlands ?"
When the crowd shouted back "Fewer!
Fewer !" a smiling Wilders answered: "We're going to organise that ."

"I have no regrets," an unrepentant Wilders added.

Four in fight to lead Britain's UKIP London, Oct 31, 2016 (AFP) - Nominations closed Monday for the leadership of Britain's pro-Brexit UK Independence Party, in turmoil after its previous new chief suddenly quit and the favourite to replace her was hospitalised following a scuffle.

Bookmakers have Nuttall as the odds-on favourite, with Evans deemed his closest challenger.
Ballot papers will be sent to members from November 11, and the result announced on November 28.
The party scored the third-highest number of votes in the 2015 general election, taking 12.7 percent of the vote, but won only one constituency.
The comments from Baz Mohammad Ahmadi, deputy minister of interior for counter-narcotics, come after the UN last week reported a 10 percent jump in opium cultivation this year to the third-highest level in more than two decades.
"Three years ago 20 provinces were poppy-free.
"The government is too busy fighting against terrorism and the Taliban and is losing the battle against drugs -- but everything is interconnected ."
International donors have splurged billions of dollars on counter-narcotics efforts in Afghanistan over the past decade, with little results.
A total of 355 hectares of poppy eradication was carried out this year, a 91 percent plunge from 2015.
Ahmadi said a big setback came in 2010 when a special Afghan unit of around 900 men, trained and equipped by Westerners to spur eradication efforts, was disbanded.
"Mafia groups, traffickers and other vested interests spread the propaganda that the group was not effective, impacting donor support," Ahmadi said.
The country has nearly three million drug addicts -- from almost nothing under the 1996-2001 Taliban regime.

Unfortunately, money does not grow in trees, and somehow it will have to be provided by April 1," Brigmanis said.

1ST LEAD; Last shelters at former migrant camp near Calais razed; By Jessica Camille Aguirre, dpa Paris (dpa) - The last makeshift structures of the former migrant camp known as the "Jungle" near the northern French port city of Calais were razed on Monday, regional authorities said.
Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has rejected concerns that the Calais evacuation prompted some migrants to travel to Paris, saying that those living in the "Jungle" had been transported to centres around France to apply for asylum.
In Paris on Monday, a police operation to check migrants' documents created tension after French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said last week that the camp - near the metro station Stalingrad - would also be cleared.
A police spokesman said the checks are conducted on a weekly basis at the camp, where some 2,500 people live under metro tracks and on sidewalks.
Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo wrote a letter to Cazeneuve and Housing Minister Emmanuelle Cosse on Friday calling on national authorities to provide shelter to the migrants, saying that between 70 and 80 migrants arrived daily in Paris.

“It shows how fickle audiences can be.
A Madea Halloween” nabbed first place for the second consecutive weekend, picking up $16.7 million to bring its stateside total to $52 million.
Reviewers vivisected the film, saddling it with a 20% “rotten” rating on critics aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.
Sony, the studio behind the film, also reined in “Inferno’s” production budget.
The picture cost $75 million to make, half the budget of “Angels & Demons.” Sony executives said they always expected “Inferno” to be more of a foreign play than a domestic bet, noting that previous Langdon adventures pulled in more than 70% of their box office from foreign markets.
“We made this film for much less and we felt strongly that it was a film that would resonate internationally.” Still, the results are disappointing, particularly for director Ron Howard, who could use a hit.

In his speech, the prime minister emphasized the situation in healthcare and education, and additional financing allotted to both.

Swedish war hero Wallenberg declared dead decades after disappearance Stockholm (dpa) - Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, credited with helping thousands of Jews in World War II, has formally been declared dead, Swedish authorities said Monday.
Wallenberg, who was born in 1912, arrived in Budapest in July 1944 to work at the Swedish legation.
After filing the application to the tax authorities in March 2016, his family held a memorial service and decided to let "Raoul rest in peace," Stockholm daily Expressen reported.
The tax authorities listed his death date as July 31, 1952, the report said.
In 1989, Wallenberg's family were given his passport and some other items by the Soviet authorities. The family had continued their attempts to trace him and cooperated with volunteer committees.
Two years later, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Sweden and Russia appointed a joint working group to investigate his fate but could not find definite answers.
Oettinger made the comment at a business association event on Wednesday, and a video of his speech was published on YouTube on Friday.
"That was a sloppy remark that in no way was meant to disrespect China," Oettinger told conservative German newspaper Die Welt.
When the paper asked what he meant when he used the phrase, "rascals and slant eyes," Oettinger responded: "I wanted to show how dynamic the world is in the digital sector... and what a challenge the enormous pace of the catching up of countries like China and South Korea represents for us ."
"The Chinese are simply clever," he added.
He said given Germany's liberal welfare system, with its generous maternity, retirement and pension benefits, it would n't be surprising if they also introduced "forced gay marriage ."

Survey: 40 percent of Austrians voted FPÖ at least once The Local Seven out of ten Austrian voters believe that the government does not have the country’s problems under control - but the majority would still not want to see the right-wing Freedom Party as part of the governing coalition, according to a new survey.
Like populist parties elsewhere in Europe, the FPÖ has increased its support after stoking public fears about record immigration and rising unemployment.
Norbert Hofer, often described as the far-right's "friendly face", hopes to become the European Union's first far-right head of state in the December 4th re-run of Austria’s presidential election.
The survey also asked participants if they had ever voted for the Freedom Party in local, state or national elections. 22 percent said that they had voted for the FPÖ several times, and 18 percent said they had voted at least once for the FPÖ.
Those who said they had voted for the FPÖ were the most dissatisfied with the current government, a coalition of the Social Democrats and the conservative People’s Party.
However, only 31 percent of those surveyed felt that the FPÖ has a clear plan on how to govern Austria.
64 percent - including FPÖ supporters - said they believed that Austrian society would be split if the Freedom Party were to be included in the federal government.

Saeima approves in principle amendments differentiating compulsory procurement component in electricity rates RIGA, Oct 31 (LETA) - Saeima reviewed amendments to the Electricity Market Law in the first reading today, and approved the amendments in principle. The amendments differentiate compulsory procurement component in electricity rates depending on connection capacity and electricity consumption volumes, as a result of which light bills are expected to increase for small consumers.
Regardless of controversy, the Economics Ministry said that differentiating the compulsory procurement component would reduce the cost of electricity for about 650,000 households, while for 350,000 households electricity cost would increase.
According to the amendments, the average mandatory procurement component will reduce for companies with connection capacity of 110 kilovolts (kV) and 6 to 20 kV, as well as households with connection capacity of 0.4 kV, and increase for the rest of consumers with connection capacity of 0.4 kV.
The changes will prompt consumers to choose more effective connection capacities, as well as increase electricity consumption in Latvia in the long term as they will create more favorable environment for energy-intensive companies.
The rates will increase for households with low electricity consumption, but the increase will be compensated for protected consumers.

Saeima moves to abolish port duty RIGA, Oct 31 (LETA) - Saeima today passed in the first reading draft amendments to the law on ports that would abolish the so called port duty.
Representatives of the Transport Ministry, which drafted the amendments, said that under the current legislation the freeports of Riga and Ventspils, as well as the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) of Liepaja pay the port duty to the government basic budget for the use of strategic infrastructure. These payments are equal to the ports' contributions to the local governments' special budget, or 10 percent of the ports' fees.
Port authorities are entitled to claim a budget subsidy in the size of 90 percent of their payments to the government basic budget, while the remaining 10 percent are spent on the maintenance of state roads.
The draft legislation would abolish the requirement for the port authorities to make the payment for the use of Latvia's strategic infrastructure, because the given situation where 90 percent of these payments are reimbursed creates an unnecessary bureaucratic and inexpedient mechanism, requiring additional work and resources.

Opposition lawmakers criticized the budget blueprint, saying that it does not give hope for improvement in areas vital to the people and that the measures planned in the 2016 budget would hurt small businesses.
Although coalition MPs were far from anonymous on certain issues, they tried to disprove the opposition's arguments against the budget proposals.

Last year, President Xi Jinping said the military would reduce its personnel numbers - by 300,000, to less than 2 million - so it could better focus on technological advances.
Military experts say the build-up, combined with Tuesday's presentation, are all parts of China's efforts to show off its military strength to the United States and its neighbouring countries, with many of which it is feuding for control of islands and waterways in surrounding seas.

Iraqi forces reached the edges of Mosul on Tuesday, two weeks into a massive operation to retake the city they lost to the Islamic State jihadist group in June 2014.

Most estimates put the number of people trapped in Mosul at more than a million, but accurate numbers are impossible to come by after more than two years of jihadist rule in the city. jmm/srm

Meanwhile, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Prime Minister Binali Yildirim were holding talks in Ankara.
The area over the border is controlled by the Kurdistan Regional Government of northern Iraq, with whom Turkey generally maintains good relations.
Turkey was excluded from the operation.
Ankara is also currently in a row with Baghdad over a military base it maintains northern Iraq, against the central government's wishes.
Over the weekend, those militias began to oust Islamic State from areas near Tel Afar, located about 90 kilometres from the Turkish border.
Tel Afar is home to ethnic Turkmen some of whom are Shiite while the others are Sunni.
Turkey is also angered over bases held in northern Iraq by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a militant group which has been locked in conflict with Ankara for decades in what it says is a struggle for the rights of the Kurdish minority in Turkey.
Iraqi army forces had entered areas within "the left bank of the city of Mosul," Iraq's Joint Operations Command said.

"A small number of hostile foreign actors have developed and deployed offensive cyber-capabilities.
"If we do not have the ability to respond in cyber-space... we would be left with the impossible choice of turning the other cheek and ignoring the devastating consequences or resorting to a military response.
"We will not only defend ourselves in cyber-space, we will strike back in kind when we are attacked," he added.
The finance ministry earlier called on businesses to "up their game" in the fight against cyber-crime, with Hammond adding that "government ca n't deliver innovation -- that's something that only businesses and entrepreneurs can do".
However, he promised that the government would take "a more active cyber-defence role" to "block, disrupt an neutralise malicious activity... and make Britain to be the best place in the world to be a tech business".

Awash with cash: Bulgaria seizes fake millions underwater Sofia, Nov 1, 2016 (AFP) - Bulgarian authorities said Tuesday they had seized a record amount of over 13 million euros' ($14.4 million) worth of counterfeit notes, most of them recovered by scuba divers in a reservoir.
"This is one of the largest amounts of counterfeit euros ever encountered (worldwide)," he told journalists in the central city of Plovdiv, after one of the counterfeiters confessed to the ploy and led authorities to the hiding place.
Three Bulgarians were arrested in connection with the case, including the owner of a printing company who has already been sentenced to six years for money counterfeiting, the officials said.

In years past, the Knicks might have relied too much on Anthony late in games like Saturday's.
Anthony, who ended up with 20 points on 5-for-15 shooting, six rebounds and five assists, was just fine with sharing the shots -- and the spotlight.
"You do n't see me complaining about it.
You did n't see me out there making a face," Anthony said. "[ It's] something that I embrace.
He added: "We know that the ball does n't have to be in my hand every single time down the court for us to make things happen.
There will come a time where that has to happen, but right now, we're just trying to get comfortable with one another and play off of each other and guys do what they do best ." Coming into the season, some questioned how Anthony would fit with Rose, another high-usage player, and what it all meant for Porzingis' development.

Democrats sue Trump for alleged voter intimidation in four states Democratic Party officials sued Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in four battleground states on Monday, seeking to shut down a poll-watching effort they said was designed to harass minority voters in the Nov. 8 election.
In lawsuits filed in federal courts in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Arizona and Ohio, Democrats argued that Trump and Republican Party officials were mounting a "campaign of vigilante voter intimidation" that violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act and an 1871 law aimed at the Ku Klux Klan.
"Trump has sought to advance his campaign's goal of'voter suppression 'by using the loudest microphone in the nation to implore his supporters to engage in unlawful intimidation," the Ohio Democratic Party wrote in a legal filing.
Since August, Trump has urged his supporters to monitor polling locations on Election Day for signs of possible voting fraud, often urging them to keep a close eye on cities like Philadelphia and St. Louis that have high minority populations.
Many states allow campaigns and political parties to monitor balloting, although they often face restrictions.

Delna and Providus call on Kucinskis to use his authority to improve the work of the KNAB RIGA, Nov 1 (LETA) - According to a report from Transparency International Latvia (Delna) and the Providus center for public policy, external supervision of the Corruption Prevention Bureau (KNAB) has been lacking the past several years, and Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis (Greens/Farmers) should use his authority to improve the situation.
The report points out that KNAB employees have complained to the prime minister, prosecutor general, Saeima and the mass media on many occasions to the incompetence and leadership style of KNAB chief Jaroslavs Strelcenoks.
If former Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis (Unity) used his authority and his legal right to review the decisions made by the KNAB chief and annul decisions he saw as illegal, then these other officials have failed to do so.
The report points out that even though Prosecutor General Eriks Kalnmeiers said last year that the"work of the bureau has been far from perfect" and criticized its investigation methods, no specific actions followed.
Delna and Providus call on the responsible officials to properly monitor the KNAB to make sure it is working effectively and in accordance with the law, so that it does not create losses for the state and its capacity is not weakened, while at the same time protecting the independence of the bureau.
Construction of concert hall on the AB Jetty not an option anymore - Kucinskis RIGA, Nov 1 (LETA) - The AB Jetty on the of Daugava River opposite Old Town is not being considered as an option anymore for the construction of the acoustic concert hall, Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis (Greens/Farmers) told members of the press today.
The PM admitted that there are several disadvantages to constructing the new concert hall on the AB Jetty, including accessibility, as well as substantial costs, believed to be over EUR 100 million.
''The government decided today that the concert hall project must be more ambitious and will not move forward with the most modest project.
As reported, the government today approved in principle construction of an acoustic concert hall in some of the degraded areas of Riga, in cooperation with a private partner.
After hearing the Culture Ministry's report, the government decided that the public entity would decide the concert hall's main features, while the private partner would be in charge of design, construction, and management of the facility. According to the Culture Ministry's report, the concert hall would be bought out by the state in twelve years after constructed.

Strelcenoks has undermined team spirit and violated KNAB law - report RIGA, Nov 1 (LETA) - According to a report from Transparency International Latvia (Delna) and the Providus center for public policy, since Jaroslavs Strelcenoks has headed the Corruption Prevention Bureau (KNAB), team spirit within the bureau has gradually been undermined, and the bureau's chief has on various occasions violated KNAB regulations.
From 2009, there was a period when the KNAB worked together as a unified team, and there was mutual trust amongst the bureau's employees. However, after Strelcenoks became the new head of the bureau, this team spirit was gradually wiped out, as work became more orientated towards administrative matters and the de-motivation of employees.
The authors of the report point out that Strelcenoks has autocratically used his authority and violated KNAB regulations.
At the same time, KNAB staff have on many occasions complained about the lack of proper communication between the bureau's chief and the rest of the staff, as Strelcenoks mostly communicates just with his deputies and does not involve himself in personnel matters.
Meanwhile, the dismissal or departure of experienced KNAB staff members threatens the bureau's competence in combating corruption.
For example, his deputy Janis Roze continues to work as a drivers' instructor, while the head of the Legal Department Ieva Otomere continues to conduct weight loss classes.

Shoigu did not specify any figures in his speech.
Commanders said they were still looking at the incident, but defence sources claimed it appeared to have been a planned attempt to portray British troops as hooligans.
When the fighting was over, a Latvian accompanying the soldiers followed the film crew and saw them go into a media outlet known to be sympathetic to Russia.
One defence source said: “Our assessment is that this is clearly a set up: ‘Lets go and make these guys look like thugs and film it.’” Last night it was not immediately clear if any one was hurt in the fight.
An Army spokeswoman said: “We are aware of an incident involving two soldiers in Riga.
The circumstances are being investigated and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.” The Foreign Office declined to comment.
Russia has criticised the build up and British troops have been warned they could be subject to Russian spying or subversion during tours in Eastern Europe.

"Joey Barton has been told he will return to full-time training following the conclusion of a disciplinary procedure," the club said in a statement.
"The management team will inform the player of appropriate training arrangements to which he must adhere for as long as he remains a Rangers player.
"Neither the club nor the player will comment further ."
Barton, capped once by England, is also in the sights of the Scottish Football Association (SFA), who accuse him of placing 44 bets between July 1 and September 15.
Betting on football matches by players is strictly forbidden by the SFA and Barton could face a ban if it is proven he placed the bets.

Russia declares 10-hour Aleppo'humanitarian pause 'on Friday Moscow, Nov 2, 2016 (AFP) - President Vladimir Putin has ordered a 10-hour truce on Friday in the war-ravaged Syrian city of Aleppo, the Russian defence ministry said.
"A decision was made to introduce a'humanitarian pause 'in Aleppo on November 4 from 9:00 am (0600 GMT) to 19:00," the chief of Russia's General Staff Valery Gerasimov said in a statement on Wednesday.
Gerasimov said the decision was approved by Syrian authorities and was meant to "prevent senseless casualties" by allowing civilians and armed combatants to quit rebel-held eastern Aleppo.
He said eight corridors -- six for civilians and two for fighters -- could be used for this.
Rebels launched a major assault Friday to break the siege of Aleppo but have been met this week by fierce resistance from regime forces.
Football: Mourinho gets one-match touchline ban, fine London, Nov 2, 2016 (AFP) - Embattled Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho will serve a one match touchline ban and pay a £50,000 ($60,000, 55,000 euros) fine after being punished by the Football Association over two separate incidents on Wednesday.
The 53-year-old Portuguese received the ban for being sent to the stands during the 0-0 draw with Burnley last weekend and the fine for remarks he made ahead of the Premier League game with Liverpool.
He also receives a mandatory £8,000 fine for being sent to the stands.
"The Commission found the disrepute element of the charge proven and as well as being fined, Mourinho was warned as to his future conduct.
"Separate to this, Mourinho will serve an immediate one-match touchline ban after he admitted using abusive and/or insulting words towards a match official and accepted the standard penalty.
"He is such a great boy and has worked so hard that he deserves better luck than this.
"But it is this same personality that means he will come back as good and as strong from this latest setback as he has done in the past ."
"I'm told the likely lay off is anywhere from between seven to nine months," Klopp said.
Bale celebrated in style just days after signing one of the most lucrative deals in the history of football to tie his future to the European champions until 2022.
"It has implications for so many aspects of our relationship," he said.
"It presents the most significant economic and social challenge of the past 50 years ."
Kenny said he had agreed with British Prime Minister Theresa May that" there will be no return to the borders of the past ."
"Therefore the retention of an open border is critical," he said.
Gerry Adams, president of Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein, said the Irish government should aim to secure "designated special status" for Northern Ireland in the EU during the Brexit negotiations.
"That threatens no one's constitutional preference and this state [Ireland], as a continuing member of the EU, has the right, and in our view the obligation, to bring forward such a proposal," Adams told the meeting.
Kenny said he had agreed with May on the need to preserve the Common Travel Area, which allows Irish and British citizens to travel between the two countries without a passport and grants mutual voting rights in the two countries.

China slams EU Commissioner's'slitty eyes' comment Beijing, Nov 2, 2016 (AFP) - China expressed disdain Wednesday over European Commissioner Guenther Oettinger's use of the term "slitty eyes" to describe Chinese people in a leaked recording of a speech to business leaders.
"The relevant remarks reveal a baffling sense of superiority entrenched in some Western politicians," Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular press conference.
"We hope that they can learn how to view themselves and others objectively and respect and treat others as equals ."
The comment was "a somewhat sloppy expression that was not meant in any way disrespectfully towards China," Oettinger told Die Welt newspaper on Saturday.
Latest MH370 report suggests plane dived rapidly at the end Sydney (dpa) - A new analysis of data from missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 suggests the plane was diving uncontrollably moments before it plunged into the ocean.
"The analysis says the aircraft was in a high and increasing rate of descent at the time of its last signal," Dan O'Malley, a spokesman from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, told dpa.
The bureau said its latest examination of wing flap debris, which was found washed up in Tanzania, concluded the flap was "most likely" not in an extended position when the plane went down.
It supports the theory that the plane entered an uncontrolled dive when it ran out of fuel before it plunged into a remote part of the Indian Ocean.
"It is absolutely clear that right now a very bitter and harsh referendum campaign is out of place and out of logic.
Especially when we are all working to give a home to those who have lost it," Alfano told the RTL 102.5 radio network.
He said the government would not take the initiative, "but if part of the opposition were ready to consider the option of postponing, I would be convinced that such a move would be worthy of consideration ."
Several media said there may also be legal reasons for rescheduling, if a Milan court accepts a request to split the referendum from a single question over the entire proposed package into separate ones on different aspects.
A ruling could come by the end of the week.
Kyrgyzstan to hold constitution vote Dec 11 Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, Nov 2, 2016 (AFP) - The parliament of Kyrgyzstan on Wednesday endorsed plans to hold a referendum on December 11 on controversial constitutional changes for which the country's president has been criticised.
Atambayev has repeatedly spoken of the need for constitutional change as the end of his single term in office approaches ahead of elections in 2017.
Atambayev's Social Democratic Party quit the ruling coalition last week over other parties' resistance to constitutional reforms, forcing the government to resign and sparking fears the country could be plunged into instability.
The Venice Commission, an advisory body of the Council of Europe rights and democracy organisation, has said the proposed reforms "negatively impact the balance of powers" in government and weaken judicial independence.
The ex-Soviet republics of Azerbaijan and Tajikistan both held referendums this year on constitutional changes that strengthen the power of incumbent autocrats.
"We really appreciate Greece's stance to not agree with the policy of sanctions," Lavrov said Wednesday in Athens.

Formula One: Vettel escapes sanctions for Mexico Grand Prix rant Paris, Nov 1, 2016 (AFP) - The FIA Formula One governing body on Tuesday let off Ferrari star Sebastian Vettel with a warning for an expletive-filled rant against the race director at the Mexico Grand Prix.
The German four time world champion, furious over the driving of Red Bull's Max Verstappen, repeatedly swore at Whiting during the closing stages of Sunday's race.
But it added: "Immediately following this incident, Sebastian Vettel spontaneously sought out Charlie Whiting to express his regrets for his behaviour in person.
"He then, again on his own initiative, sent letters to each of the FIA president Jean Todt and Charlie Whiting, in which he apologised profusely for his actions.
Vettel was reminded that the governing body "expects all participants in its championships to be respectful and mindful of the example they set for the public and the younger generation in particular.
The ex-champion was already penalised 10 seconds for blocking Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, dropping him from third to fifth in the final race standings.
One resident of east Mosul said the IS jihadists had "demanded that people, especially young people, gather in the area's schools, and that they bring their identity papers with them".
But most people had "refused to obey those orders," Abu Yunes told AFP, adding they were fearful that IS wanted to use them as human shields.
Abu Mohammed, a west Mosul resident, said IS had "gathered a large number of people from areas south of Mosul and forced them to move to the city ."
"The majority of Daesh members are now deployed on the right bank, and they are apparently ready to fight, after they prepared car bombs and suicide bombers and snipers, as well as rigging streets and bridges" with explosives, Abu Mohammed said, using an Arabic acronym for IS.
Mosul is split by the Tigris River, with the eastern half of the city known as the left bank and the western as the right bank.
Abu Mohammed's description of IS deployments squares with expectations the jihadists will put up the toughest fight in western Mosul, which is still not cut off from territory they hold farther west in Iraq and in Syria.

Indian Kashmir schools shut after deadly shelling Srinagar, India, Nov 2, 2016 (AFP) - Hundreds of schools were ordered to close indefinitely in Kashmir Wednesday after a flare-up in violence between Indian and Pakistani security forces in the disputed region left 14 civilians dead.
Eight civilians, including two children, were killed on Tuesday when mortar shells hit two locations in Samba and Rajouri sectors.

Armed Forces have received 34 reconnaissance vehicles from Great Britain so far RIGA, Nov 2 (LETA) - The National Armed Forces have so far received 34 tracked reconnaissance vehicles from Great Britain, as the Defense Ministry's Press Department informed LETA.
Before shipped to Latvia, the vehicles are overhauled and modernized in Great Britain, and Latvia is to receive the vehicles in several shipments from 2016 to 2020.
In the meantime, Defense Minister Raimonds Bergmanis (Greens/Farmers) visited Saeima today to again explain the procurement of the tracked vehicles as requested by Harmony MPs.
"The armored vehicles were used during the recent Sword 2016 military exercise, and the results were very good.
I have no doubt that buying these vehicles was the right decision," said Bergmanis.
Instead, Elksnins "is carrying on Russia's propaganda traditions by trying to manipulate public opinion about the vehicles and the procurement conditions," said Bergmanis.
The platforms can be modernized and equipped with the latest communications equipment and weapons.
Designing a military vehicle is very costly, and only the richest countries in the world can afford it. CVRT is the fastest and most maneuverable vehicle in its class, and the vehicles supplied to Latvia will be equipped with Israel's Spike anti-tank missiles, the latest NATO communications and command systems, 30-millimeter guns, and others. The procurement contract is worth EUR 46,591,746.
Together with the infrastructure upgrades necessary for the vehicles, and the cost of maintenance, ammunition, and training, the project will cost Latvia EUR 249,514,638 in total.
"I love Michael Douglas but he is misinformed," the former Batman actor wrote on his Facebook page, refuting Douglas' claim.
"The last time I spoke to him was almost two years ago, when I asked him for a referral for a specialist to get a diagnosis for a lump in my throat, which prevented me from continuing a tour of my play.

AUBURN HILLS, Mich. — Kristaps Porzingis said it didn’t cost the Knicks the game, but he would have preferred to get out on the court sooner in the fourth quarter when the club’s offense came to a screeching halt in a 102-89 loss to the Pistons on Tuesday night.
Coach Jeff Hornacek preferred to go with a more defensive-oriented lineup that included Lance Thomas, who has struggled to score this season.
“Of course, ’’ Porzingis said when asked if he wanted to play more in the fourth.
“The second half I was better offensively.
But that’s the decision the coach made.
He thought it was best for the team. At that point.
Trump used dubious methods to avoid taxes: report Washington, Nov 1, 2016 (AFP) - Donald Trump used tactics to avoid paying taxes that were so "legally dubious" that his own lawyers advised him the government would deem them improper, the New York Times reported Tuesday.
Citing newly obtained documents, the Times said the Republican presidential candidate was scrambling to stave off financial ruin in the 1990s and worked to avoid reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in taxable income.
The report said Congress later outlawed one of the tactics Trump used that potentially allowed him to avoid paying tens of millions of dollars in personal income taxes.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks suggested the New York Times either misunderstood or misread US tax law. "Mr. Trump does not think that taxpayers should file returns that resolve all doubt in favor of the IRS.
"The migrants demonstrated a hostile and violent attitude.
Many were armed with sticks and they attacked the officers when they tried to prevent them from entering," the Spanish government's representative in Ceuta said in a statement.
The migrants were taken to a short-stay immigrant centre while Spanish authorities determine their legal status, a local police spokesman said.
In 2014, 15 migrants drowned as dozens tried to swim to Ceuta from a nearby beach.
At the time, human rights groups and migrants said Spanish police tried to keep them from reaching the shore by firing rubber bullets and spraying them with tear gas.

Russia seeks'honest 'cooperation in Syria: Lavrov Athens, Nov 2, 2016 (AFP) - Russia seeks "honest cooperation" for a political solution in Syria, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday as Moscow declared a brief truce in the war-ravaged city of Aleppo.
"We hope our partners will draw (the) necessary conclusions (so that) we will all aim for honest cooperation... for a political process involving both the government and opposition forces," Lavrov said at the start of an official visit to Greece.
However, he insisted that Washington help enforce a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning support for extremist groups in Syria.
"When we adopted this resolution, I remember US Secretary of State John Kerry's words.
"Almost a year has passed and we await these words to be carried out," he added.
No candidates put forward for Jurmala mayor as yet RIGA, Nov 2 (LETA) - No candidates have been nominated for the vacant post of Jurmala mayor so far, LETA learned after speaking to several politicians.
Jurmala City Council member Janis Ledins (Greens/Farmers) said that the Union of Greens and Farmers had not yet nominated its candidate.
Neither have the Greens/Farmers decided when to discuss the matter, but this could happen in the coming weeks, he said.
A few other members of Greens/Farmers said, off the record, that former Jurmala Mayor Gatis Truksnis could be repeatedly nominated for the job.
Jurmala City Council's coalition will have to discuss the issue, and Zugovs believes that, given that the previous mayor was a member of Greens/Farmers, a representative from some other political party could take the job now.
Defense Minister Raimonds Bergmanis (Greens/Farmers), Defense Ministry's State Secretary Janis Garisons, National Armed Forces Joint Headquarters' deputy head, Brigadier General Ivo Mogilnijs, and other officials will participate in the event.
Kiukucans has been in the Armed Forces since 1992.

On Wednesday, the elite Iraqi anti-terrorism command announced that their forces were approaching two districts east of Mosul, which is Iraq's second-largest city.
The cabinet also decided to increase next year's funding by 1.16 billion euros.
The additional amounts mean Berlin will provide the states and municipal administrations with a total of 9.5 billion euros in aid this year so as to provide shelter and care for refugees in their regions.
The average cost of each asylum seeker in Germany is expected to be 670 euros a month represented by funds paid by Berlin to the states.

British soldiers "targeted in Russian propaganda plot" in Riga - newspaper LONDON, Nov 2 (LETA) - The British Army is investigating whether two soldiers were caught up in a Russian-backed plot to discredit British forces after they were set upon by a local gang and then filmed brawling while on exercise in Latvia, The Telegraph reports.
Two unnamed British soldiers were eating in a McDonalds in Riga when they were attacked and a brawl ensued.
When the fighting was over, a Latvian accompanying the soldiers followed the film crew and saw them go into a media outlet known to be sympathetic to Russia.
One defense source said: "Our assessment is that this is clearly a set up: 'Lets go and make these guys look like thugs and film it. '"
A British Army spokeswoman said: "We are aware of an incident involving two soldiers in Riga.
British soldiers have been involved in disorder while on exercise in Latvia in the past, with two accused of damaging a taxi while drunk earlier this year.
Depp, 53, one of Hollywood's top actors and box office draws, will co-star in the 2018 sequel to "Fantastic Beasts," due out in theaters on Nov. 18, Deadline.com, The Hollywood Reporter and Variety said, citing unnamed sources.
The reports also said Depp will make a cameo in the first film, but did not reveal what part he will play.
Little is known about the plot of "Fantastic Beasts," which stars Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne with a screenplay by Rowling, featuring new characters, story and set in New York in 1926, long preceding the "Harry Potter" books and films, which were set in England in the 1990s.
The new franchise will trace the rise of a powerful wizard named Gellert Grindelwald and his eventual 1945 duel with Albus Dumbledore, the popular wizard headmaster from the Potter stories.
Rowling's seven-book "Harry Potter" series sold more than 450 million copies worldwide, and the film franchise, which ended in 2011 with "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," took in more than $7 billion at the global box office.

Speaking at his pre-match press conference, Mourinho revealed that the decision to include Schweinsteiger in training was taken last Thursday and the German was informed a day later.
"It's a decision based on the fact that we are in a period of the season where it's really difficult to train with everyone together," Mourinho said.
The group, instead of being 23 or 24, becomes 13 or 14, and then, with injuries, maybe 10 or 11.
Now, for example, on Friday, the players that play here [in Istanbul] are not going to train with the main group and this is the normal routine.
"Looking at Bastian and the way he was working professionally with the fitness coach, we think that it's a human decision, a professional decision, to bring him back to the team.
He'll be much better prepared and in much better condition in case his future decision is to leave the club; he'll be much better prepared for competition if he stays with us.
At the moment, we have no problems in midfield like we have in defence but, if we have problems in midfield, it's another option for us.
Iceland president tasks conservative leader with forming govt Reykjavik, Nov 2, 2016 (AFP) - Iceland's president on Wednesday tasked conservative leader Bjarni Benediktsson with forming a new government after snap elections on Saturday triggered by the Panama Papers scandal.
"My decision is to give the chairman of the Independence Party the power to form a government that has a majority in the parliament," President Gudni Johannesson told reporters, referring to Benediktsson.

"St. Pope John Paul II had the last clear word on this and it stands, this stands," Francis said.
Francis was referring to a 1994 document by Pope John Paul that closed the door on a female priesthood.
The Vatican says this teaching is an infallible part of Catholic tradition.
Francis responded: "If we read carefully the declaration by St. John Paul II, it is going in that direction ."
The Catholic Church teaches that women can not be ordained priests because Jesus willingly chose only men as his apostles.
In August, Francis set up a commission to study the role of women deacons in early Christianity, raising hopes among equality campaigners that women could one day have a greater say in the 1.2 billion-member Church.
17 dead, 50 injured as Pakistan trains collide Karachi, Nov 3, 2016 (AFP) - At least 17 people have been killed and dozens more injured after two trains carrying hundreds of passengers collided in Pakistan's southern port city of Karachi early Thursday, officials said.

Hillary Clinton is six percentage points ahead of her rival Donald Trump in the latest US election poll - regaining the lead she held before last week's announcement of an FBI probe into the email scandal.
Many polls have shown Mrs Clinton's lead over Republican rival Donald Trump getting smaller since the email controversy reappeared in headlines on Friday.
But the Reuters/Ipsos daily tracking poll released late on Wednesday showed her six percentage points ahead - the same advantage she held before FBI director James Comey's controversial announcement. Her advantage is even stronger given that a victory on 8 November depends on the Electoral College system.
Mrs Clinton, speaking at a rally in Las Vegas, said Mr Trump was "out of his depth".

Spain's Rajoy forms new EU-looking government Madrid, Nov 3, 2016 (AFP) - Spain's leader Mariano Rajoy, who kicks off a second term after months of political paralysis, formed a new cabinet Thursday that looks set to maintain controversial economic reforms and cement EU ties.
Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, a stalwart of Rajoy's Popular Party (PP), left government and was replaced by Alfonso Dastis, 61, until now Spain's permanent representative to the European Union.
In a move likely to reassure the markets, Economy Minister Luis de Guindos remained in his post, according to a government statement.
He has stressed that more efforts will be required to reduce Spain's deficit as required by Brussels.
But the opposition says most of the jobs created are temporary and unstable.
During that time, Rajoy -- whose PP won both elections but without an absolute majority -- remained at the helm of a caretaker government with very limited powers.

He also added that the party has no other candidates, at least for now.
Unofficial information obtained by LETA also suggests that Truksnis might be the Union of Greens and Farmers' candidate for the vacant post of Jurmala mayor.
Details of the exchange between Petro Poroshenko and a man thought at the time to be Kyrgyzstan's Almazbek Atambayev appeared on the Ukrainian president's official website on Wednesday.
Atambayev's office declined to speculate about who might have imitated the president. But Russian media suggested that the confusion could have been the work of a Moscow prankster named Alexei "Lexus" Stolyarov who has staged similar stunts in the past.

1ST LEAD; Russian government not source of hacked emails, Assange says; By Gretel Johnston Washington (dpa) - Julian Assange denies that the Russian government is the source of a trove of hacked emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman.
"We can say that the Russian government is not the source," the Wikileaks founder said in an interview to be aired Saturday on the Russia-backed RT network.
"The Clinton camp has been able to project a neo-McCarthyist hysteria that Russia is responsible for everything," Assange said, referring to witch-hunts for communist sympathizers in the United States led by US Senator Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s.
Assange made the statement in an interview with Dartmouth Films, a British-based operation, which then sold it to Russia Today, according to Wikileaks.
The US government charged on October 8 that the Russian government, possibly at the highest level, had directed intrusions into the email systems used by US political organizations.
Under-pressure Greek PM to reshuffle cabinet: state TV Athens, Nov 4, 2016 (AFP) - Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was expected to reshuffle his cabinet, state TV reported Friday, in an apparent bid to boost his government's standing after unpopular austerity cuts.
Greece's central banker Yannis Stournaras has warned that the country will not be able to return to credit markets in 2018 without assurances that its debt is seen to be viable.
Germany opposes debt relief as unnecessary, but tackling the problem is a firm demand of the International Monetary Fund.
Tsipras' leftist Syriza party trails the conservative New Democracy party by up to 10 points in recent opinion polls.
The 42-year-old leader was elected in 2015 on his pledge to tear up Greece's austerity agreements.
He won a popular referendum on the issue but within weeks was forced to compromise with the country's international creditors and signed onto another multi-billion-euro bailout containing additional fiscal cuts.
Tsipras then dissolved parliament and called for fresh elections which comfortably returned him to power until 2019. hec-jph/mkh
The two presidential candidates are now tied in Florida and North Carolina, and Clinton's lead in Michigan has narrowed so much that the state is too close to call.
While Clinton remains the odds-on favorite to win Tuesday's election, Trump now has a plausible route to victory, especially if there is a sharp fall in turnout among African-Americans from the levels of the 2012 election.
Still, Trump must win both Florida and North Carolina to have a good chance of winning the White House. Clinton could lose both states and still win.
The States of the Nation project estimates Clinton's odds of winning the needed 270 Electoral College votes at about 90 percent, down from 95 percent last week.
If the election had been held on Wednesday, the project estimates, she would have had 256 solid electoral votes and an estimated final tally of about 302 votes, to 236 for Trump.
By any measure, however, Trump has had a good run in the past week. He has seen his support grow in 24 states while losing ground in 11.
Conversely, Clinton's support grew in 13 states while shrinking in 22.

The Sun editorial said in its editorial: "All our politicians... must ask themselves this: will they honour the biggest ballot box mandate in British history... or sniffily decide the little people can not be trusted and thwart them ?"
The pro-EU Guardian praised the judgement for putting parliament "back at the heart of the Brexit debate", but warned Remain supporters "not to get their hopes up" about its implications.

Denmark drops probe into WWII Nazi's alleged war crimes Copenhagen, Nov 4, 2016 (AFP) - A 91-year-old Danish man who allegedly worked as a guard in a Belarus concentration camp during World War II will not face any charges, a Danish prosecutor said on Friday.
A Danish book released in 2014 claimed Rasmussen worked as a guard in the Bobruisk camp in Nazi-occupied Belarus, citing a police report from 1945.
"We have worked closely with two historians, one of whom is the author of the book," Jacobsen said, adding that the book itself did not prove that Rasmussen had "committed concrete crimes or that he was complicit in any ."
Rasmussen, who has since changed his name and now lives in the Copenhagen area, has admitted to being part of a volunteer unit created by the Danish Nazi Party, but has claimed that he only went to Bobruisk as a 17-year-old to undergo military training.
Up to 1,000 Danes served in Bobruisk, where at least 1,400 Jews were killed, according to the book released in 2014 by Danish historians Dennis Larsen and Therkel Straede.
Test for PM in Bulgarian presidential election Sofia, Nov 4, 2016 (AFP) - Bulgarians vote Sunday in the first round of presidential polls expected to set up a tense runoff between Prime Minister Boyko Borisov's right-hand-woman and a MiG-flying ex-general seen as more sympathetic to Moscow.
While Borisov presents Tsacheva as the "mother of the nation", political scientist Dimitar Bechev warned that he fails to realise that she has a "dangerous lack of charisma".
"Radev could end up carrying the day by a small margin.
(Borisov's centre-right party) GERB will have to adjust and share some of its power.
Borisov could even experiment with early elections to strengthen his hand," Bechev said.
Burly former bodyguard and police chief Borisov, 57, has injected some much-needed stability into Bulgarian politics since becoming prime minister for the second time in late 2014.
- The job of Bulgarian president is largely ceremonial but he or she is still a respected figure who chooses some of the top security and judicial officials and who has the power to appoint technocrat governments in a crisis.
Rosen Pleneviev, the outgoing president, has been outspoken in his criticism of Russia and its President Vladimir Putin.
"What today Russia is trying to achieve is to weaken Europe, to divide Europe and to make us dependent," Pleneviev told the BBC in an interview published Friday.
He said that a cyber attack on Bulgaria last October targeting the electoral commission, presidency and other government institutions on the day of a referendum and local elections was "conducted with a high probability from Russia".
Early indications suggest that Radev might seek to fly Bulgaria more eastwards, telling Darik radio in a recent interview: "We have lost a lot by declaring Russia more or less an enemy ."

Cavalcoli said on Radio Maria that the seismic shocks were "divine punishment" for "the offence to the family and the dignity of marriage, in particular through civil unions".
The radio station distanced itself from his views and late Friday the Vatican issued a stinging rebuke, saying the idea of a vengeful God was "a pagan vision" dating from "the pre-Christian era".
Becciu asked for forgiveness from quake victims and reminded them they had the "solidarity and support" of Pope Francis.
But Cavalcoli has refused to back down, insisting to another radio station that earthquakes are indeed caused by "the sins of man" and telling the Vatican to "read their catechism".
Legislation allowing gay civil unions in Italy only took effect last month, making it the last country in Western Europe to legally recognise same-sex relationships.

Melania Trump modeled in US prior to getting work visa WASHINGTON (AP) — Melania Trump was paid for 10 modeling jobs in the United States worth $20,056 that occurred in the seven weeks before she had legal permission to work in the country, according to detailed accounting ledgers, contracts and related documents from 20 years ago provided to The Associated Press.
The details of Mrs. Trump's early paid modeling work in the U.S. emerged in the final days of a bitter presidential campaign in which her husband, Donald Trump, has taken a hard line on immigration laws and those who violate them.
It is highly unlikely the discovery will affect the citizenship status of Mrs. Trump.
The government can seek to revoke the U.S. citizenship of immigrants after the fact in cases when it determines a person willfully misrepresented or concealed facts relevant to his naturalization.
But it effectively does this in only the most egregious cases, such as instances involving terrorism or war crimes.

Germany expecting fewer than 300,000 new refugee arrivals in 2016 Berlin (dpa)? - The number of newly arrived refugees to Germany this year will total fewer than 300,000, the country's migration officials estimate.
However that number will hold only if the European Union's pact with Turkey to limits refugee inflows remains in place, the head of the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), Frank-Juergen Weise, told broadcaster MDR on Saturday.
Nonetheless, the high number of arrivals in recent years means that the percentage of people drawing on social services who originate from outside Germany remains high, according to a report in the Bild tabloid, citing Germany's labour agency.

WikiLeaks' Assange to get legal grilling: Sweden Stockholm, Nov 7, 2016 (AFP) - Julian Assange will be questioned in person next week over longstanding rape accusations, Sweden's public prosecutor's office announced Monday, saying an Ecuadorian prosecutor would visit the WikiLeaks founder in the embassy where he has been holed up since 2012.
"Ecuador has granted the Swedish request for legal assistance in criminal matters and the hearing will be conducted by an Ecuadorian prosecutor," the public prosecutor's office said in a statement.

Russia has halted air strikes on rebel-held eastern Aleppo since October 18, after international condemnation over its ferocious bombardment of the city.
President Vladimir Putin ordered an additional 10-hour "humanitarian pause" on Friday that saw Syrian forces on the ground halt fire to allow rebels and civilians to quit Aleppo.
But rebels scorned the offer to leave with their weapons, and civilians stayed put in the devastated eastern part of the city.
Peskov said that the decision by Putin to keep holding fire remained dependent on rebels in the city refraining from any concerted attacks on government-held territory.
The Chronicles of Melanie tops Latvia's list of most-watched movies RIGA, Nov 7 (LETA) - The Chronicles of Melanie, a feature by Latvian director Viesturs Kairiss, has become the most-watched movie in Latvia, as 13,000 moviegoers have already seen it since the premiere, Zane Ozola, the head of the movie's promotion campaign, told LETA.
The Chronicles of Melanie has been screened in 16 movie theaters since its premiere.
Throughout November and the beginning of December the movie will run not only in theaters in Latvia's biggest cities, but also in club houses across the regions.
Swiss actress Sabine Timoteo stars in the lead role alongside Latvian actresses Lilita Ozolina, Guna Zarina, Maija Doveika, Baiba Broka, and others.
The shooting happened at around 9:00 pm (1800 GMT) at a bar in Gure, a poor suburb in Juba's southwest.
The whereabouts of the shooter and the motive are unclear with "investigations underway," according to Kordit.
Insecurity in the capital has worsened since the start of a civil war nearly three years ago, with the widespread fighting leading to an increase in criminality and armed violence of all kinds.
1ST LEAD; 5.0-magnitude quake causes significant damage in US state of Oklahoma; By Stephen Lowman, dpa Washington (dpa) - A 5.0-magnitude earthquake damaged dozens of buildings in the central Oklahoma city of Cushing, a major US oil transport hub, officials said Monday.
Oklahoma has experienced thousands of earthquakes in recent years. Most of them have been traced to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a process in which large amounts of chemically treated water is pumped deep into the earth to help extract oil and natural gas.
Up to 50 buildings were significantly damaged, Cushing City Manager Stephen Spears told local media, including City Hall, schools and public offices.
Shaking was felt across Oklahoma and into the neighbouring states of Missouri and Arkansas.
"Following the complaint, an investigation has been launched.
Lawyer Chan-jo Jun, who had initiated the claim, said he had compiled a list of 438 cases including incitement of hate and violence as well as support for terrorist groups made on Facebook, but which he said the social network has failed to delete even though they have been repeatedly flagged up as offensive speech.
"The management violated German law, by not removing illegal content from Facebook despite being notified, and allowing the content to be publicly available," Jun said of his complaint, which he said also targets Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg and managing director of the northern Europe region Martin Ott.
Jun last year filed a similar challenge in the northern city of Hamburg but prosecutors there rejected the claim, saying that Facebook managers did not fall under German jurisdiction.

It lies on the west bank of the Tigris river, about 15 kilometres (nine miles) southeast of Mosul.
Iraqi forces have already entered Mosul from the east and were moving close to the city limits from the north on Monday but have some distance to cover on the southern front.
The Islamic State group "has no connection to Islam," he said.

Coalition agrees to back Cirule's appointment as Revenue Service's new director-general RIGA, Nov 7 (LETA) - The government coalition has agreed to back Ilze Cirule's appointment as the State Revenue Service's new director-general, Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis (Greens/Farmers), Unity vice-chairman Edvards Smiltens and National Alliance co-chairman Gaidis Berzins told journalists after today's meeting of coalition cooperation council.
Each of the three coalition parties also had separate meetings with Cirule today.

According to information found in LETA’s archive, Cirule has graduated from the Faculty of Architecture at Riga Technical University and received a master’s degree from Riga Business School in 2003.
Data from Firmas.lv show that Cirule is also a supervisory board member of Bastions ZS, an investment firm established in 1994. She also used to own shares in this company.
"Consumer prices will have grown primarily on price increases in the food segment.
Like in previous month, the clothing and footwear segment has been contributing to monthly inflation, but to a significantly lesser degree than in September.
"We expect annual inflation to remain at this rate also in the following months, and in December it is very likely to exceed 1 percent," said Vildava.
"The most striking changes in October could be seen in fuel prices.
Clothing and footwear prices will have risen as well.
Seasonal influences will be seen also in food prices, but they are not expected to rise very steeply, although prices of milk and dairy products are going to move up soon.
The price of thermal power will have remained unchanged.
Some services, including telecommunications, are also expected to have risen in price somewhat," said Gaspuitis.
"This will be the highest food price inflation since 2013 and it might become even steeper in the following months," the Citadele Bank economist said.
He also projected a 2-3 percent increase for fuel prices, but said that the price of thermal power probably remained unchanged for now.
During the last 12 months, consumer prices moved down 0.2 percent as compared to the the previous 12 months in September.
Corruption Prevention Bureau to consider recovering litigation costs from Draveniece and Strike RIGA, Nov 7 (LETA) - The Corruption Prevention Bureau will look into the possibility of recovering the cost of litigation in several legal disputes from the former bureau officials Juta Strike and Ilze Draveniece, as the Corruption Prevention Bureau's spokeswoman Mara Priedite told LETA.
Draveniece recently turned to Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis (Greens/Farmers), asking the premier to consider ordering the Corruption Prevention Bureau's head Jaroslavs Strelcenoks and other officials who, in Draveniece's opinion, are responsible for more than EUR 50,000 that the bureau had to pay in litigation expenses, to compensate the amount to the bureau.
However, instead of evaluating Strelcenoks' responsibility, Kucinskis at the end of October asked Strelcenoks to look at Draveniece's letter and, if necessary, evaluate other Corruption Prevention Bureau officials' responsibility.
One of the key factors in the litigation with Draveniece was that Strike, then acting head of the bureau, overturned Strelcenoks' decree dismissing Draveniece as the head of the Corruption Prevention Bureau's Legal and Human Resources Department.

'Do for Hillary what you did for me, 'Obama urges Americans Ann Arbor, United States, Nov 7, 2016 (AFP) - President Barack Obama on Monday urged Americans to make history by electing Democrat Hillary Clinton to succeed him in the White House, and reject the "mean-spirited" politics of Donald Trump.
"You have the chance to reject a coarse, divisive, mean-spirited politics that would take us backwards," he said.
"The chance to elect our first female president ."
Obama reminded voters that his administration rescued the state's dominant auto industry from the brink of collapse in 2008.
"All that progress goes down the drain if we do n't win tomorrow," he said, adding, "This race will be close here in Michigan, just like it will be in a lot of parts of the country ."
"The good news is, you do n't just have to vote against something.
A candidate who is smart.
A candidate who's tested.
The next president of the United States -- Hillary Clinton !"
California, Arizona, Nevada, Massachusetts and Maine will vote on legalizing marijuana for recreational use, making it available for adult possession, purchase and consumption.
The votes are likely to greatly expand the market for legal marijuana in the US, creating a large block of territory in the western US and outposts in the east where the drug is legally available.
Some experts believe they could also create a snowball effect, making eventual nationwide legalization all but inevitable.
Marijuana is already legal for recreational use in the western states of Alaska, Washington, Oregon and Colorado and the US? capital district of Washington DC.
But possession, use or sale of marijuana remains a crime in most US states. Marijuana possession accounted for more than 600,000 arrests in 2014.
At the same time, new laws have driven the development of a new, 7-billion-dollar market for legal marijuana, according to market researchers Arcview.
The changes in law track with changes in public opinion.
In 1996, when California voters passed the first ballot measure legalizing medical use of marijuana, just a quarter of US citizens believed the drug should be legal.
Those arguing for legalization cite the social and financial costs of prohibition, including billions spent to enforce marijuana laws, and the drug's widespread use to alleviate suffering of AIDS? and cancer patients and as a treatment for epilepsy and other diseases.
Even a partial win for legal marijuana will increase tension between state laws allowing the drug and federal laws which continue to prohibit it. Marijuana remains illegal under federal law, classified with heroin as a Schedule 1 drug.
"If we're successful, it's the beginning of the end of the war on marijuana," California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom told the New York Times.
Coalition expects State Chancellery to propose the best way to select Corruption Prevention Bureau's head RIGA, Nov 7 (LETA) - Although none of the candidates for the post of the Corruption Prevention Bureau's head were selected for the second round of competition at the end of October, members of the ruling coalition do not have anything to offer, and are expecting State Chancellery's Director Martins Krievins to propose the best way to find a new head for the bureau.
Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis (Greens/Farmers) has tasked Krievins with presenting his proposals concerning optimization of the Corruption Prevention Bureau's operations in two weeks.
Augusts Brigmanis, head of the Greens/Farmers Saeima group, said that he had no suggestions about the best way to select candidates for the Corruption Prevention Bureau, nor had he anything to say whether the bureau should be reorganized.
Corruption is one of the reasons why the government is unable to allot sufficient financing to various sectors, including healthcare and teachers' salaries, added Smiltens.
He said he was not ruling out that the Corruption Prevention Bureau might have to be reorganized, and that experts' opinion would have to be taken into account.
Likewise, supervision of the bureau is a very complex matter: on the one hand, the Corruption Prevention Bureau must be independent from politics, but on the other hand, the prime minister should have the option of intervening in the bureau's activities when necessary.
The National Alliance's co-chairman Gaidis Berzins told LETA that the prime minister was to offer changes necessary to find a new head for the Corruption Prevention Bureau.
The National Alliance is also waiting for the State Chancellery's report.
As reported, ten candidates applied for the Corruption Prevention Bureau's head, but a commission set up to evaluate the candidates concluded on October 28 that none of the candidates, including the current Corruption Prevention Bureau's Chief Strelcenoks, could qualify for the second round of competition.
On the other hand, Saeima National Security Committee's Chairwoman Solvita Aboltina (Unity) said that reorganizing the Corruption Prevention Bureau should be discussed.
Knicks do n't want to play solely through Porzingis NEW YORK -- Coming into the season, many wondered how the New York Knicks would fit together on offense. Would Derrick Rose adapt to the triangle?

Proposal to change rules for choosing Corruption Prevention Bureau's head causes suspicions of desire to appoint someone easily manipulated - Delna RIGA, Nov 7 (LETA) - Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis' (Greens/Farmers) proposal to change the rules for choosing the Corruption Prevention Bureau's next head causes suspicions of a desire to appoint someone weak and yielding to political influences, Janis Volberts, director of Transparency International Latvia (Delna), told LETA.
Volberts, who participated in the work of the tender's commission in the capacity of an advisor, says that Kucinskis' proposal caused him to doubt the prime minister's willingness to strengthen KNAB.
The KNAB law stipulates that the anti-corruption bureau's head is chosen by a commission, consisting of the State Chancellery's director as chairperson, the prosecutor general, as well as the heads of the Constitution Protection Bureau and the Security Police.
"The prime minister's announcement of the intention to change the rules of the competition and the official in charge of it raises a serious question about a possible desire to appoint to this office a weak person who could be politically influenced and would be close to the prime minister and his party," Volberts said.
The fact that Ventspils mayor Aivars Lembergs (For Latvia and Ventspils) has also criticized the current selection procedure makes the situation even more alarming, Volberts said.
Last week, Kucinskis said on Latvian Television that the best solution would be to charge the prosecutor general with picking the best candidate for KNAB chief who would then be recommended to the government.
"When I woke up today, it did n't feel any different to be number one.
It was nice to get it, but on court you are not thinking of the ranking.
The best in the world are here, every match is tough ."
"I got a little bit lucky with the qualifying (after losing in the Paris first round) ."
"Our group is really tough, so we will see who goes through," Cilic, winner of the Basel title last month, said.
"In the last few weeks I got back into the race again.
I'm excited to make it back for the second year and happy to be a part of this group of players ."
German politician jailed for Nazi death camp tattoo Neuruppin, Germany, Nov 7, 2016 (AFP) - A German court on Monday sentenced a far-right local politician to eight months in jail after he was spotted at a swimming pool with a tattoo of a Nazi slogan and a rendering of the Auschwitz death camp.
Prosecutors at the time complained that the sentence against Zech, a local council member of the neo-Nazi NPD party, was too lenient.
Explaining his appeal verdict, judge Joern Kalbow said a lesser sentence could have been interpreted as "the state backing down in the face of right-wing radicalism", DPA news agency reported.
It featured the German words "Jedem das Seine" (To Each His Own) -- the message at the front gate of the Buchenwald concentration camp -- below a picture of the former Auschwitz concentration camp.
Bulgaria exit polls show narrow win for Socialist ally in presidential vote Former air force commander Rumen Radev narrowly won the first round of presidential elections in Bulgaria on Sunday, exit polls showed, raising prospects of political instability in the small Black Sea state and a strategic shift toward Russia.

Prior to the vote, he pledged to step down if his party's candidate lost the first round.
"We will wait to see the final results. We are mobilizing our forces for the second round and I think we have a chance to win it.

China says elected Hong Kong lawmakers ca n't retake oaths Beijing, Nov 7, 2016 (AFP) - China effectively barred two elected pro-independence lawmakers from Hong Kong's legislature Monday after they deliberately misread their oaths, saying that they could not be sworn in again.

Italian marines rescue more than 1,000 migrants in Mediterranean Rome (dpa) - Italian marines rescued more than 1,000 migrants in the Mediterranean Sea and they were brought to Palermo in Sicily.
The ANSA? news agency reported Monday that 10 bodies were also found.

Drama and surprises The first polling stations close on the East Coast at 7:00 pm (0000 GMT Wednesday), and the last far out in Alaska at 0600 GMT Wednesday.
The drama begins at 0000 GMT when polling stations close in Georgia, South Carolina, Vermont, Indiana and Kentucky.
Half an hour later, the surprise could come from the battleground states of Ohio and North Carolina, which have 18 and 15 electoral votes, respectively.
Ohio, a fallen industrial powerhouse, is historically Democratic territory while North Carolina tends to vote Republican.
But either could swing the other way this year.
Over the next 90 minutes or so, a burst of results from some 30 states accounting for dozens of electoral votes will further fill in the red and blue electoral map.
Much attention will also be paid to the small northeastern state of New Hampshire, which normally votes for Democrats but is seen as possibly up for grabs this time, and Pennsylvania, another former industrial powerhouse that normally leans Democratic and holds a prize of 20 electoral votes.
Heading west, Arizona and Texas -- conservative states that border Mexico -- are seen as possible prey for Clinton.
And in the other direction, Colorado, Michigan and Wisconsin -- Democratic strongholds that account for 35 electoral votes between them -- are seen as maybe going to Trump.

The money can be used to meet unexpected expenses, with the leftover funds returning to EU capitals.
They also decided to increase the 2016 budget allocation to tackle migration, a decision that requires the approval of EU lawmakers.

(w/SECOND ADD) - Government appoints Cirule as new director-general of State Revenue Service (with additional information throughout) RIGA, Nov 8 (LETA) - The government today appointed Ilze Cirule as the new director-general of the State Revenue Service (SRS).
Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Greens/Farmers) informed ministers that one of the most important tasks for Cirule will be the formation of a new SRS work strategy.
She will also have to continue moving forward with the reforms within the revenue service, including the merger of the Finance and Customs Police, as well as the strengthening of internal security.

Education and Science Minister Karlis Sadurskis (Unity) also called on the new SRS chief to cooperate with education institutions, like, for example, the Education Quality Service, which inspects violations in the education sector.
After her appointment, Cirule pointed out that she values the importance of cooperation, which is why in her first days on the job she will not only try to get a grasp of the situation within the revenue service, but also the state administration as a whole.
''The SRS can not do its job separately from these institutions, which is why I am ready to meet and discuss cooperation with ministries, social partners and other related sides," she emphasized.

US using Apache helicopters in the battle for Mosul Washington, Nov 7, 2016 (AFP) - The United States is using Apache helicopters in the battle to retake Iraq's second city of Mosul after more than two years of Islamic State group rule, the Pentagon said.
The helicopters are being used "with significant effect" in Mosul, he said.
However, few helicopters are being used, with officials suggesting that the number of choppers is in the single digits.
The helicopters fly at lower altitudes and slower speeds than fighter jets and bombers, making them much more vulnerable to enemy fire and increasing the risk of casualties.
Special forces have been enabled to conduct raids to capture or kill IS group leaders.
US military advisers are also moving closer to the front line.

Sources: Phil Jackson unhappy with Knicks' limited use of triangle offense Phil Jackson has n't been pleased with the New York Knicks' performance on offense -- particularly with the number of times the team has run the triangle offense -- during their 2-4 start, league sources told ESPN.
New Knicks coach Jeff Hornacek has tried to speed up the offense this season and has n't run much of the triangle in the first six games.
The Knicks rank 13th in offensive efficiency thus far. A bigger issue for the club is on defense; it entered play Monday ranked last in the NBA in points allowed per 100 possessions, which is likely bothering Jackson just as much as the offense.
During his time as Knicks president, Jackson has on occasion said he'd want his teams to run the triangle.
"We talked what we feel is a good working way to run it with different options. We'll get to all those as the year progresses, but it should be pretty easy ."

EU adds to Crimea sanctions blacklist Brussels, Nov 8, 2016 (AFP) - The European Union has added several people, including some recently elected to Russia's parliament, to its sanctions blacklist for their role in supporting Moscow's seizure of Crimea from Ukraine, officials said Tuesday.
The 28-nation EU refuses to recognise Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea and insisted Russian parliamentary elections held there in September were illegal.
In June, it rolled over for another year asset ban and travel freeze sanctions against individuals and companies said to have aided Russia's takeover of the Black Sea peninsula.
In September, the EU extended by six months similar sanctions against Russian and Ukrainian individuals for aiding and abetting pro-Moscow rebels in eastern Ukraine.
In July, the bloc extended much more damaging economic sanctions against Russia for another six months, citing a lack of progress in resolving the Ukraine conflict.
Juncker warns Turkey slipping away from EU Brussels, Nov 8, 2016 (AFP) - European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker on Tuesday warned President Recep Tayyip Erdogan against moving Turkey further away from Europe and jeopardising its EU membership bid.
"I say this with bitterness, I who am a friend of Turkey, that each day Turkey moves further away from Europe," Juncker said in an address to the College of Europe in Bruges.
The Turkish foreign ministry rejected Juncker's comments as baseless and bashed the EU for having "lost its credibility".
The Commission chief called on Ankara to reaffirm its commitment to join the 28-member European bloc.
"If tomorrow we were to refuse visa liberalisation, the fault would not be ours but the Turkish authorities.
The winning entries will be announced at the end of November.
"We are well aware that this is an especially challenging task, as modern architectural and design solutions have to be of such quality that would carry added value for the historic urban environment of central Riga.
At the same time, the solution has to blend in the urban environment so as not to compromise the status of the historic center of Riga as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
For this, a broad range of experts had to be brought together - architects, urban planning specialists, railroad experts, and landscape architects," said Merirands.
All designs that are participating in the competition will be posted on the edzl.lv portal from November 17.
According to Culture Ministry's expert and jury member Janis Dripe, this is an infrastructure project of unprecedented complexity - it will transform the urban environment of central Riga, combining innovative visions of architects, transport technologies, and engineers.
The main criteria for evaluation of the designs include architectural solutions offered by the given project, functionality, mobility and accessibility of the complex, and logistics of the construction process.
Merkel warns of possible Russian interference in German vote Berlin, Nov 8, 2016 (AFP) - Chancellor Angela Merkel on Tuesday said Russia could try to influence Germany's general elections next year through cyber attacks or disinformation campaigns, after Washington accused the Kremlin of similar meddling in the US vote.
"So it may be that this could also play a role during the election campaign ."
Washington last month formally accused the Russian government of trying to "interfere" in the election by hacking US political institutions, charges the Kremlin has repeatedly dismissed.
Germany's domestic secret service earlier this year accused Russia of a series of international cyber spying and sabotage attacks, including a case which targeted the German lower house of parliament last year.

SIDEBAR; Trump beats Clinton 32 to 25 in New Hampshire's midnight voting Washington (dpa) - A trio of small towns in a remote corner of New Hampshire cast the first election day ballots for US president early Tuesday, with Donald Trump beating Hillary Clinton 32 to 25 in the overall count.
The three communities' small handful of residents voted at the stroke of midnight, in an quadrennial election ritual that goes back to the first half of the 20th century.
Clinton, the Democratic Party's nominee, beat Republican Trump four votes to two in Dixville Notch.
She also scored a 17 to 14 victory in Hart's Location, a town with a population of about 40 people.
But the real estate mogul trounced Clinton 16 votes to four in Millsfield, a few kilometers south of Dixville Notch.
It was the fist time the community had held such a vote in decades.
The event garners headlines and curiosity each election cycle, even if it is n't considered predictive of how residents of the rest of the small north-eastern state will vote during the daytime hours.

Originally, though, the EU 16 million had been earmarked in the Health Ministry's 2017 budget, but since the money is being allocated to the hospital's construction project already this year, the above sum will be deducted from the Health Ministry's 2017 budget.
French investigators name plotter of Paris, Brussels attacks Paris, Nov 8, 2016 (AFP) - French investigators have identified a Syria-based extremist of dual Belgian and Moroccan nationality who is thought to have plotted the attacks in Paris and Brussels, sources close to the case told AFP on Tuesday.
Oussama Atar, a 32-year-old believed to be a member of the Islamic State group, was already a suspect in the March 22 attacks on Brussels but has now been linked to the November 13 atrocities in Paris last year.
"He's the only coordinator from Syria to have been identified during the investigations," one of the sources told AFP.
French investigators have long suspected that the Paris attacks, in which teams of jihadists killed 130 people, were coordinated by one or several people from Syria, but have never named anyone before.
Another two cousins, Moustapha and Jawad Benhattal, were arrested on June 18 on suspicion of planning an attack in Belgium during a public screening of a Euro 2016 football match, Belgian media reported at the time.
Trump's election could be very dangerous to the stability and security of the Western world - Rasmussen RIGA, Nov 8 (LETA) - If Donald Trump is elected U.S. president, this could be very dangerous to the stability and security of the Western world, as he has raised doubts about the credibility of NATO and its collective defense, former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in an interview with LETA and the Defence Matters military news portal.
Which I do not think he will but if he might then he would undermine the credibility of NATO.
I would expect a more tough minded approach towards Russia if Clinton is elected president and I think we need that," he added.
The former NATO secretary general also believes that the EU must extend sanctions against Russia for a period of at least 12 months, not six as is now.
Actually, in the long term, I think we should make sanctions open-ended so that we could send a very clear signal to Russia that it could be lifted if Russia changes its behavior.
So, we should strengthen sanctions and, secondly, if Russia continues to destabilize Eastern Ukraine, I also think we should consider delivery of weapons to Ukraine.
As an adviser to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, Rasmussen does not ruled out that the conflict in Ukraine could become yet another frozen conflict.
I do not think the Russians want to solve these problems.
On the one hand, I would not expect Russia to try to integrate more Ukrainian land into Russia as we have seen in Crimea because that would be much too expensive for Russia.
I do believe that the West should be tougher on Russia in that respect," he went on to say.
He also said that sanctions must be extended for at least 12 months due to a lack of unity within the EU.
Slate and Votecastr planning to break election information embargo ABC CLEVELAND -Slate and a new company called Votecastr plan to break the traditional Election Day information embargo, publishing real-time projections before the polls close.
For decades, media outlets have agreed not to publish election projections until all the precincts in each state have shut their doors in an effort not to influence voters who have yet to cast their ballots.
Traditionally this information is only accessed by campaigns.
Justin Buchler, Associate Professor of Political Science at Case Western University tells News 5 the move is a huge break from journalistic norms.
“This is going to be very different, we don’t know what the effects will be of having this kind of information public.” Buchler pointed to the 2000 presidential election when networks called Florida for Al Gore before precincts in the Florida Panhandle precincts had finished voting.
This time around, Buchler said it’s very difficult to determine the impact that these early numbers could have on voter turnout.

The e-health project has been worked out by the National Health Service.
The new e-health system has been harshly criticized by physicians who say that the product is not yet ready for launch.

Italy's Grillo: Trump-Clinton race is "final blow to American dream" Rome (dpa) - The choice voters have in the US Presidential elections is "the final blow to the American dream," Beppe Grillo, the comedian who leads Italy's anti-establishment opposition Five Star Movement (M5S), said Tuesday.
"Hillary [Clinton] and [Donald] Trump are both lacking in credibility, they are both scary for what they represent rather than for the power they have.
"The land of opportunity has gradually turned itself into a country with more than 2 million prison inmates, millions of poor people and delusions more and more detached from reality: I hope that this election brawl will not be the final act," Grillo said.

The court has acquitted Anatolijs Sproge and Fjodors Martinovs in vote buying charges in favor of Harmony.
Back in February, Sproge and Martinovs pleaded guilty to the court for buying votes in favor of the Unity party, not Harmony, during the 12th Saeima elections.
However, the prosecutor in the case attempted to prove that the men had actually bought votes in favor of Harmony.
According to the prosecutors, ahead of the 12th Saeima elections Sproge "recruited" Martinovs to find persons willing to vote for Harmony's ticket in the 12th Saeima elections in exchange for money and alcohol.
Julian Assange defends leaking Hillary Clinton's emails London (dpa) - Wikileaks founder Julian Assange defended leaking Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's emails on Tuesday and denied supporting her Republican rival Donald Trump.
Assange, who has been living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for four years, denied being motivated by influencing the outcome of the election.
"At the same time, we can not publish what we do not have.
"To date, we have not received information on Donald Trump's campaign, or Jill Stein's campaign, or Gary Johnson's campaign or any of the other candidates that fulfills our stated editorial criteria," Assange said.
"WikiLeaks remains committed to publishing information that informs the public, even if many, especially those in power, would prefer not to see it," he said.
The demand could complicate the legal battle facing Prime Minister Theresa May, who has promised to appeal last week's court ruling that the approval of the British parliament in London is required before Brexit negotiations begin.
Scotland's highest legal officer, the Lord Advocate, "will lodge a formal application to intervene" in the appeal once May's government has formalized its appeal to Britain's Supreme Court, the Scottish government said.
"And triggering Article 50 will inevitably deprive Scottish people and Scottish businesses of rights and freedoms which they currently enjoy," Sturgeon said.
"It simply can not be right that those rights can be removed by the UK government on the say-so of a prime minister without parliamentary debate, scrutiny or consent ."

She said criticism from abroad "does not reflect why Donald Trump is running and who he would be on the global stage".
The study by University of Southern California computer scientists found that both Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton had supporting messages from "bots" but that Trump had more bots and produced more tweets.
"This generates a stream of support that is at staggering odds with respect to the overall negative tone that characterizes the 2016 presidential election campaigns," researchers Alessandro Bessi and Emilio Ferrara wrote in the online journal First Monday's November 7 edition.
"The fact that bots produce systematically more positive content in support of a candidate can bias the perception of the individuals exposed to it, suggesting that there exists an organic, grassroots support for a given candidate, while in reality it's all artificially generated ."
The researchers analyzed 20 million tweets generated between September 16 and October 21 by about 2.8 million distinct users, and estimated that over 400,000 accounts "are likely bots ."
Using automatically-generated tweets and messages can distort "trending" topics on Twitter, and give Trump and his supporters the ability to claim, for example, that he won the presidential debates.
"Our findings suggest that the presence of social media bots can indeed negatively affect democratic political discussion rather than improving it, which in turn can potentially alter public opinion and endanger the integrity of the presidential election," the researchers said.
Voters face hours-long wait at swing-state polling places Washington (dpa) - Americans going out to polling sites on Tuesday were reporting lengthy lines and hours-long waiting times, especially in the toss-up states that will determine who becomes president.

Hungary's Orban suffers rare defeat in refugee vote Budapest, Nov 8, 2016 (AFP) - Hungary's radical right Jobbik dealt all-powerful Prime Minister Viktor Orban a rare defeat on Tuesday as it blocked his bid to change the constitution to bar the resettlement of refugees.
But Jobbik is currently vying with the Socialists as the second most popular party in the country, and laid a surprise ambush for Orban earlier this month.
Spotting a rare opportunity for leverage, Jobbik's leader Gabor Vona had announced after a recent one-on-one meeting with Orban it would vote for the bill. But this was on the condition that the government scraps a controversial cash-for-residency bond scheme for wealthy foreigners, particularly from Russia, China and the Middle East.
Jobbik have long called the residency bonds, generally sold via offshore companies, a "dirty business" and a national security risk that could be exploited even by Islamic State jihadists.
"Neither poor nor rich migrants should be allowed to settle in Hungary," Vona said.
But Orban later told parliament that the government "would not give in to blackmail" and urged Jobbik not to connect the bond scheme with the change to the constitution which he called "an affair of national importance".
Observers say Tuesday's vote could set the scene for a growing power struggle between Fidesz and Jobbik ahead of the next scheduled general election in 2018.
Undeterred, Orban still hailed the outcome as "a sweeping victory" over "Brussels bureaucrats" and vowed to change the constitution to "reflect the will of the people".

Riga City Council turns to Constitutional Court over new system of teachers' salaries RIGA, Nov 9 (LETA) - The Riga City Council has turned to the Constitutional Court over the new system of teachers' salaries.

3RD LEAD; Republicans keep control of US Congress; By Anne Walters and Valerie Hamilton, dpa Washington (dpa) - The Republican Party will control not only the White House, but also both houses of the US? Congress, after fighting off an attempt by Democrats to wrest away control of the Senate.
The victory in Tuesday's elections leaves control of both houses of Congress unchanged, in a win for the centre-right party's legislative agenda. A Republican-controlled Congress could give Donald Trump support for proposals including hard-line immigration rules, a wall on the US-Mexico border and protectionist trade reforms that would certainly have been blocked by a Democratic majority.
However, many prominent congressional Republicans have been strongly critical of Trump, and it remains to be seen whether Republicans will work with him on his agenda or pursue their own.
The Senate also has the power to confirm, or block, the next president's nominees for the Supreme Court.
The current Republican Senate has stalled on confirmation hearings for President Barack Obama's nominee to the nation's highest court since March, leaving the judicial body with eight justices.
By midway through election night, only one seat had changed parties, as Democrats took a Senate seat from Republicans in Illinois.
Democrats held on to the Nevada seat being vacated by retiring Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, according to US broadcaster projections. With the victory, Catherine Cortez Masto will be the first Hispanic woman in the US Senate.
Some of the party's most prominent legislators celebrated victory Tuesday, including Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, re-elected to his congressional seat from the Midwestern state of Wisconsin, and former presidential candidate John McCain, elected to a sixth term from the south-western state of Arizona.
Republican Senator Marco Rubio was also projected to win re-election in Florida.

We did it with open eyes, we knew that Russia could easily go back to a more assertive attitude.
But they did not want this, so we have to realize that and adapt to this dramatically changed security situation in Europe," Rasmussen said.
''Until February 2014 we considered Russia a partner, we had a lot of cooperation activities ongoing with Russia, but on February 2014 they attacked Ukraine and later they illegally annexed Crimea into the Russian Federation.
So we realized that our vision on the partnership was not shared by the Russian leadership, so Russia changed from being a strategic partner to becoming a strategic challenge.
We are now in a new situation because Russia’s aggressive behavior has created a new security environment.
This is the reason why it makes sense that NATO has decided to increase the presence in the east.
I think we did it at the right time and it sends a very clear signal to Russia that they should not even think about attacking one of the Baltic states or any other NATO ally because that would mean an invocation of article 5," he emphasized.
Asked how far Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to go, the objective of the Kremlin at the moment is to keep their neighbors weak and dependent on Russia, but that an open attack against the Baltics is not believable, as they are protected.
''I think he has a big masterplan. I think his masterplan is to restore Russian greatness in the territories covered by the former Soviet Union.
And to that end he needs to keep his neighbors weak and dependent on the Kremlin.
And he wants to prevent them seeking integration with NATO and European Union.
It is also about Transnistria and Moldova, it is about South Ossetia in Georgia, it is about NogornoKarabakh between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
I do not think an open attack of the three Baltic states, for instance, is an imminent threat thanks to Baltic states’ membership of NATO, they are protected.
''I think the bottom line is that even the Russian speaking communities in the Baltic states would not like to join Russia.
But, of course, many of them are watching Russian television and Russian television today is propaganda like in the Soviet times.

"We don’t know when a big one will come, but it will and there will certainly be fatalities," said French seismologist Remy Bossu from the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) in Paris And when it does strike, Bossu says, we could see the scale of damage seen in the historic Italian town of L’Aquila which was devastated by an earthquake five years ago that left nearly 300 dead.
After the quake six scientists were jailed for manslaughter for playing down the risks of earthquakes.
South-eastern France is also awash with centuries-old towns and villages like L'Aquila but whether or not the next big quake proves as devastating will depend on exactly where it strikes, Bossu says.

But Russia in a statement quoting spokesman Igor Konashenkov said it was "counterproductive and against common sense" to extend the ceasefires "just for the sake of it, not to bring real help to peaceful civilians, but so that terrorists can better restore their battleworthiness".
Russia said Thursday that it had brought more than 100,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid to Aleppo in recent months "irrespective of any humanitarian pauses".
"Those who really want to help the residents of Aleppo, are helping them," the ministry said.

Interpol elects senior Chinese official as president Nusa Dua, Indonesia, Nov 10, 2016 (AFP) - A Chinese security official was elected president of Interpol on Thursday for the first time, a potentially controversial choice as Beijing pursues a campaign to hunt down fugitives abroad.
Vice Minister of Public Security Meng Hongwei was chosen as the new head of the global police organisation at its annual general assembly on the Indonesian island of Bali, France-headquartered Interpol announced.
He is the first Chinese official to hold the post, China's official Xinhua news agency said, and takes over from Frenchwoman Mireille Ballestrazzi.

He was arrested in Zurich in May 2015 as part of a US-led investigation into graft at football's world governing body.
Esquivel was extradited to the United States in March 2016 and placed under house arrest in Florida after pleading not guilty.

During the closed part of the government's meeting today, ministers heard the Culture Ministry's report on the strategy for revitalization of Teika and Ciekurkalns neighborhoods of Riga, and the potential risks to implementation of the strategy should the European Commission not lift its financial aid ceilings, which are currently set at EUR 5 million for cultural buildings.
However, given the schedule of the project the Riga City Council's decision is understandable, and the Commission has not yet said whether the reconstruction project and the procurement are being planned correctly.
The Culture Ministry has still not received the Commission's confirmation that the procurement is being organized correctly.
It is quite possible, however, that the ceiling on maximum funding available for the project could be lifted, said the minister, explaining that Latvia was not the only country to encounter such problems, as the Commission has not yet introduced precise criteria for cases like this.
The Riga City Council previously said that it was hoping EU funds would cover EUR 6 million of the project's total cost, EUR 11 million.
German terror probe shows Syrian aimed to attack Berlin tourist spots Berlin (dpa) - A 19-year-old Syrian under investigation on terrorism charges in Germany was researching attack targets in Berlin including the Bundestag parliament building, the Brandenburg Gate and the busy Alexanderplatz square, a document released Thursday showed.
The details about the terrorist attack plans of Shaas Al-M, whose full name was withheld in line with German privacy laws, are contained in a Federal Court of Justice document that extends his investigative custody by a period of three months.
Investigators say Shaas Al-M, arrested in March on suspicion of membership in the Islamic State extremist group, "was planning to carry out an attack in Germany on behalf of IS with two unknown individuals" and had phone conversations about the plot.
Prosecutors say Shaas Al-M joined Islamic State in 2013.

As reported, the KNAB has decided to strip Unity of public funding after a court ruling, penalizing the party for violating campaign spending rules. The KNAB ruling means that Unity will not receive public funding until the next parliamentary election.
The Riga Regional Court has also upheld the anti-corruption bureau’s decision obliging Unity to pay a EUR 4,000 fine for the violations of campaign spending rules.
Disagreeing with the KNAB ruling, Unity filed a complaint, which the KNAB chief dismissed.
The party appealed this decision before the Riga Vidzeme District Court, but the appeal was also rejected.
Since 2012 public funding is granted to Latvia’s political parties that have won more than 2 percent of votes in the last Saeima elections.
In accordance with the results of the 2014 Saeima elections, public funding was granted to six political parties and electoral blocs. Unity was entitled to receive EUR 141,669 annually, or EUR 35,417 quarterly.
Political parties, however, can use not only public funding, but also donations made by their sponsors, as well as membership fees.
N. Korea urges policy shift from Trump administration Seoul, Nov 10, 2016 (AFP) - North Korea on Thursday warned the incoming Donald Trump administration will have to deal with a "nuclear state", saying Washington's push for denuclearisation was an "outdated illusion".
"If there is anything the Obama administration has done... it has put the security of the US mainland in the greatest danger," said an editorial carried by the ruling party newspaper Rodong Sinmun.
The United States has always maintained it can not accept North Korea as a nuclear state and under President Barack Obama has made talks with the North conditional on Pyongyang first making some tangible commitment towards denuclearisation.
Although Trump has not laid out a clear direction for his policy on North Korea, he has indicated that he would be open to negotiations with its leader Kim Jong-Un to talk him out of his nuclear ambitions.
"If he came here, I would accept him," Trump told supporters in Atlanta last June.
"I have been very encouraged by the interest in president-elect Trump in wanting to work with my team around many of the issues that this great country faces," Obama says while sitting next to Trump in the Oval Office.
"I believe that it is important for all of us regardless of party and regardless of political preference to now come together to deal with the many challenges we face," Obama continues. dpa aw sdl
Massive cyberattack hit five top Russian banks: Kaspersky Moscow, Nov 10, 2016 (AFP) - A massive cyberattack has hit at least five of Russia's largest banks, Moscow-based internet security giant Kaspersky said Thursday.
The attacks were still continuing on Thursday.
Most lasted around one hour but the longest lasted almost 12 hours, Kaspersky said.
More than half the devices were in the United States, India, Taiwan and Israel, Kaspersky said.
Contacted by AFP, Russia's central bank confirmed that it had identified "attacks on a number of large banks," describing their intensity as "medium" and saying they did not disrupt access to banking services.
Kaspersky said that DDoS attacks "have long been one of the most popular instruments used by criminals to attack businesses ."
Such attacks have grown more frequent in recent years with the development of online banking but also in the context of heightened tensions over the crisis in Ukraine with attackers targeting the sites of the Kremlin and NATO.
The Raging Bull actor released a controversial video last month (Oct16) in which he said he would like to punch the Republican, calling Trump "an idiot, a national disaster, an embarrassment to this country... this fool, this bozo".
that he would no longer be tempted to attack the billionaire property tycoon.
"Are you still going to punch Donald Trump in the face ?"
"Because you could now get arrested for that, I think ."
"I can’t do that now he’s president," the actor replied.
"I’ll probably have to move (to Italy)," he laughed.

The amendments to the Law on State Social Insurance and Microenterprise Tax Law have been criticized by several business organizations.
Latvian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) board chairman Janis Endzins said the amendments to the Microenterprise Tax Law were unacceptable as they stipulated liquidation of microenterprises, without putting anything in their place.
Latvian Employers Confederation's representative Peteris Leiskalns also said that several companies would lay off workers if the amendments were approved.
"Had these concerns materialized, it would have been a desert here.
Yet we still have one of the fastest development rates," said the minister.
Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Greens/Farmers) said that the changes to the regulations on social contributions had been approved last year, and there was enough time to prepare for the changes. In addition, the amendments also stipulate tax breaks for pensioners, people with disabilities and young people.
Furthermore, it was decided that the microenterprise tax would be reduced from 9 percent to 5 percent, the minister reminded.
Nevertheless, no proposals regarding the amendments will be accepted for now, and the amendments will be reviewed by Saeima in the second reading now.
Party leader Andris Piebalgs said in a a press conference today that after listening to the public, the party will have an open list of candidates for the Riga elections, which will be made up of various members of non-governmental organizations and associations, as well as professionals from different sectors.

Piebalgs emphasized that the party wishes to gain at least 14 to 15 percent of the vote, which the party achieved four years ago.
Kirsis said in a press conference today that it is a shame that people are fleeing Riga because they simply do not wish to live there anymore, as well as they can not afford to live in the expensive capital city.
At the same time, he said that it is quite hard for entrepreneurs to start a business in the capital, as the current city council is not interested in developing business activities in the city.
At the same time, Unity plans to work actively to attract investors to Riga, as the current city council is doing nothing at the moment to assist investors to begin their activities in the capital.
Furthermore, he will reduce the price of municipal services, so that Riga is not the most expensive city to live in the Baltics anymore.
Asked whether he would be prepared to work in the opposition, Kirsis said that he is focusing on a positive result for him becoming Riga mayor, but added that he is prepared to work and fight to improve Riga.
He also said that he understands that work in the opposition in the Riga City Council is a tough job, but that if Unity becomes a party in power it will not be revengeful to its opposition members.
This was one of the reasons Clinton failed to win enough votes in key swing states like Florida and Pennsylvania to tip the balance of electoral votes in her favour.

The Times said that was eight percentage points higher than the Hispanic vote for Mitt Romney in 2012.
The fall-off in Clinton's share was due to black men.
Whites: Well over half of white voters - 58 per cent - chose Trump, an increase of 1 percentage point over 2012, according to the New York Times exit poll.
Gender: Surprisingly, given all of the attention to Trump's attitudes and behaviour toward women, Clinton was able to increase the percentage of female voters who voted Democrat by only 1 point.
A majority of women - 54 per cent - voted for her, but that compares with 53 per cent who voted for Obama in 2012.
Among men, 53 per cent voted for Trump, an increase of five percentage points over 2012.
Party affiliation: Republicans turned out in a big way for Trump. Prior to the election many observers thought a significant number of them would either vote for Clinton or a third-party candidate.

Fire and Rescue Service's trade union wants cash-only compensation for overtime work RIGA, Nov 10 (LETA) - The trade union of the officials and employees at the State Fire and Rescue Service is planning on turning to courts in the near future, claiming that the rights of the Fire and Rescue Service officers have been violated and that laws and regulations on rates for overtime work have been interpreted one-sidedly by government institutions.
According to the Fire and Rescue Service's offer, 90 percent of overtime work done by the service's employees will be compensated in cash and the remaining 10 percent - by rest days.
The trade union claims this is unacceptable and not even possible because, according to the law, overtime work may be compensated with rest days only within a four-month period, not two years as is the case, while the Constitution states that every employed person has the right to receive, for work done, commensurate remuneration.
On June 16 this year, the Supreme Court's Department of Administrative Cases accepted Gulbis' claim that downtime during the Fire and Rescue Service's duty shifts should be considered duty hours and paid accordingly.
In August, the government decided that up to EUR 7 million would be allotted this year to compensate firemen and police officers' overtime work in 2016.
He said that in the short-term the election of Trump is certainly beneficial for Russian President Vladimir Putin, as it creates uncertainty for other countries who can not be sure whether they can depend on the United States.
As long at the Trans-Atlantic alliance is united, Russia can not challenge it.
At the moment, it is clear that large cracks have appeared in the Trans-Atlantic community after Brexit, the current stance Central and Eastern European countries are taking in the refugee matter, and now the election of Trump.
Spruds said that this trend could continue with a possible referendum in Italy and a potentially unstable government, as well as the elections in France and Germany next year.
Spruds emphasized that it is not possible to predict the long-term impact of a Trump presidency on Russian foreign policy.
He said that we must look at what will happen the coming months.
Since Trump said that a Hillary Clinton election would be more favorable for Russia during the last days of the pre-election campaign, as she is too soft and ineffective, it is not clear what Trump's attitude towards Russia will be.

US ambassador warns of Trump-type victories in Europe euobserver Donald Trump's victory should serve as a lesson for Europe's mainstream forces ahead of their own ballots next year, the US ambassador to the EU said.

Trump has about 70 days to put together a 15-member cabinet, and the names of several of his close advisors have been mentioned as options to fill key posts.
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is heading the transition team, and he is believed to be in the running for attorney general, along with former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani.
Trump assumes the presidency on Inauguration Day, January 20, 2017, and President Barack Obama has stressed that one of his main priorities is to assure a peaceful and smooth transition of power.
"Probably now they are trying to rush to gain access to certain targets where they can get a better understanding on what is going on in Washington after the election and during the transition period," said Jaime Blasco, chief scientist with cyber security firm AlienVault.
Some of the emails appeared to be from Harvard University under the subject line, “Why American Elections are flawed, ” according to Washington-based cyber security firm Volexity.
A former senior Obama administration official said on Thursday that the White House had decided to take action against Russia after the election but no decision had been made on exactly how to respond.
Options included U.S. prosecutors indicting Russians believed to be behind the attacks, applying new economic sanctions against Moscow and the United States launching a retaliatory cyber attack against Russia, said the former official who asked not to be named.
White House officials feared that retaliating before the election could have led Russia to launch a major cyber attack on the United States that would have disrupted the banking system, power grid or internet service.
But they said administration officials had decided that the United States needed to show after the election that it would respond to state-sponsored cyber attacks, said the former official.
Trump has said he is not convinced Russia was behind the attacks.
He has yet to fill key national security posts, which makes it difficult to assess how his administration might handle the issue.

Prime Minister Binali Yildirim met with the chairman of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), Devlet Bahceli, on Thursday to discuss changing the constitution.
"We view the prime minister's thoughts on the constitution, which he shared with me today, as positive and appropriate," Bahceli wrote on Twitter following his meeting with Yildirim.
"While there is no political agreement yet, I hope the coming period can solve the de facto situation forced on the country," Bahceli added.
The AKP has 317 seats, and the MHP 40.
The two biggest opposition parties, the secularist CHP and the pro-Kurdish HDP, both oppose an executive presidency and some opinion polls have shown that a majority of Turks also do not want the change.
The MHP wants to see debate on reinstating the death penalty, which Erdogan has continuously said he would approve if it passed parliament, revived as part of the AKP's constitutional change package.
"We have no desire other than being the leader of the solution, not part of the problem; to light the way for peace and order, not be the architect of chaos," Bahceli said.

"Maybe I should have thought better when I staked the government's fate on my choice...
I was wrong and I will take full responsibility," the burly leader told private bTV television on Wednesday.
The party won the ballot but then refused to form a minority cabinet, sparking a period of political upheaval until Borisov returned to power in November 2014.
But his popularity has been waning in recent times.
"Mrs Tsacheva represents the status quo" while the outspoken Radev is seen as an agent of change, analyst Zhivko Georgiev of the Gallup Institute told AFP. "Borisov's threat to step down has more mobilised his opponents than supporters," he added.
- A victory for Radev might see ex-communist Bulgaria, which has long walked a tightrope between Moscow and Brussels, lean more towards Russia, observers said.
Outgoing president Rosen Pleneviev, due to step down on January 21, has been outspoken in his criticism of Russia and its President Vladimir Putin.
But at the same time Bulgaria's economy is reliant on Russian gas, and the two have deep historical and cultural ties.
Instead, she recently accused him of being a "red general" and threatened a return of totalitarianism if Bulgarians back him on Sunday.

Troubles of Russia's M2M Private Bank unlike to impact operations of Latvia's Bank M2M Europe - FCMC RIGA, Nov 14 (LETA) - The Finance and Capital Markets Commission (FCMC) does not expect the current difficulties of Russia's M2M Private Bank to seriously impact the operations of the Latvia-based Bank M2M Europe.
Although one of the shareholders in the Latvian-based bank with a similar name, Bank M2M Europe, indirectly owns shares also in M2M Private Bank, the FCMC notes that Bank M2M Europe is a legally autonomous entity, which operates in Latvia and meets Latvia's regulatory requirements. The FCMC therefore does not expect the situation with the Russian bank to seriously affect the operations of the bank in Latvia.
According to the data of the Association of Latvian Commercial Banks, Bank M2M Europe was the 17th biggest bank in Latvia by assets at the end of June.
Russia's ATB bank, the sole owner of M2M Private Bank, which caters to wealthy clients, has said that it has been working with the Russian central bank on a plan to stabilize M2M Private Bank, which on November 10 suspended all payments and earlier failed to carry out repo transactions.

"Independently of the result of the US? election, it was always clear to us that Europe must shoulder more responsibility,"? German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said ahead of joint talks with her 27 EU counterparts and the bloc's foreign ministers.
"Europe must not await the decisions of others.
It must defend its interests," added French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.
"Instead of planning expensive new headquarters or dreaming of a European army, what Europe needs to do now is to spend more on its own defence - that is the best possible approach to the Trump presidency,"? British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said.
Instead, the proposal is about "providing the capabilities, the structures, the tools, and the financial resources" needed to tackle external conflicts and crises, build the capacities of partner states and protect the EU and its citizens, Mogherini added.
Key aspects include: improving the civilian response to threats such as migration, terrorism and organized crime; more funds to develop capabilities such as a euro-drone and fighter jets; and projects including a European mobile hospital and a logistical hub.
But efforts to create a select group of member states willing to cooperate more closely on defence issues - described by some as a so-called Schengen of defence, in reference to Europe's group of border-free countries - are premature, an EU diplomat said on condition of anonymity.
"Today I think a step is being taken - a small step, but in a very important strategic direction for the EU and particularly important at such a complicated moment," Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni noted.

Minsk sees nothing wrong with Latvia reinforcing its border MINSK, Nov 14 (LETA -- RIA NOVOSTI) - The border guard service of Belarus sees nothing wrong with Latvia's efforts to reinforce its border, Alexander Tishchenko, a spokesman for the the State Border Committee of Belarus, said in an interview with Sputnik Belarus radio station.
Tishchenko, however, urged journalists against using the terms "fence" or "wall" in this context.
He said that the media probably have been using the word "fence" for more colorful expression, but that the process in fact involves providing and installing the necessary equipment in the border area.
"The Latvian borders are being trespassed by groups of illegal migrants from Vietnam, which as a rule are accompanied by people from Chechnya, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan," the Belarusian official said.
According to the Environmental Protection and Regional Development Ministry's report discussed by the Cabinet of Ministers' Committee today, public institutions, depending on their specifics and information and communication technologies available to them, can choose the safest electronic communication channels that suit them best.
One option is the Environment for Integration of National Administration Document Management Systems, or DIV.
However, there are different solutions available to ensure secure delivery of public institutions' information to private individuals' e-mail addresses. Therefore public institutions have to analyze options available to them for secure document and information exchange with residents and businessmen, says the Environmental Protection and Regional Development Ministry's report.
Local governments, too, have to take into consideration that they will have to choose the best solution available, and that European Union funds will be available to them for this purpose.
This past June, Saeima passed the Official Electronic Address Law, which lays down the rules on accessing official electronic address accounts by their users, deactivation of electronic addresses, and others.
The law will come into force on July 1 next year.
The minister dismissed media reports that this had been an extraordinary ministerial meeting and explained that this was just a regular informal conversation about current affairs, which this time focused on the result of the U.S. presidential election and cooperation with the incoming U.S. administration, as well as the bloc's common position, given that the U.S. is the EU's strategic partner.
"Yesterday, practically all colleagues were unanimous that, respecting the result of the election and also the priorities declared by the new administration, is is necessary to build contacts with people in the new Department of State and the National Security Council as soon as possible, perhaps even before the new administration takes office and the new president is inaugurated," Rinkevics said.
Rinkevics also named a number of problematic issues, first of all relations with Russia and settling the Ukraine conflict.
"I felt a strong unanimity among my colleagues that the EU must stick to the policy it has been following so far, that is, the implementation of the Minsk agreement, cooperation with the U.S.," Rinkevics said.
"The colleagues also had very many questions about future cooperation with the U.S. on the implementation of the Paris climate agreement and also the free-trade agreement with the U.S.
CFOs of Large Baltic enterprises concerned about demand, labor force - survey RIGA, Nov 14 (LETA) - Demand, availability of skilled labor and salaries are the main issues worrying large enterprises in the Baltic states, reveals a survey of large Baltic enterprises' chief financial officers (CFO).
Availability of skilled labor is also a pressing issue in all three Baltic states, with 43 percent of CFOs in Lithuania, 39 percent in Latvia and 33 percent in Estonia considering it a problem.
Ints Krasts, a board member at SEB Banka, commented that labor-related issues are still among the most serious risks that might start affecting the Baltic states' largest enterprises already in the nearest future.
Unemployment figures have been dropping in all three Baltic states, and in Estonia the jobless rate has already decreased 6.5 percent.
With workforce availability reducing, worries about salary trends in Latvia and Lithuania have been rising especially fast.
In Latvia, for instance, only 5 percent of large companies are concerned about access to financing, and 7 percent are worrying about interest rates.
There are two explanations for that. Firstly, the large companies have accumulated substantial resources in recent years and have provided themselves with sufficient financial reserves.
Companies, for instance, are currently only using 38 percent of the credit facilities granted to them by SEB Bank.
The latest survey, which was conducted in September 2016, covered 263 companies from Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia that had reported more than EUR 20 million in annual turnover.

By the time the VAT is repaid by the state, the first company dissolves and is impossible to track down.
At the center of the Estonian Tax Board's investigation is the Unico Gold company, which also has a subsidiary in Latvia.
In Estonia, Unico Gold used to sell gold to the company Deoro, where Gombergs is a member of the board.
Just like Deoro in Estonia, B221 used to buy gold from Unico Gold, and then sold it to BASF in Great Britain.
And in both cases, VAT had never been paid, TV3 reported.
Gombergs told the television that all the deals involving his company were perfectly legal, and that it was buying scrap gold from a reliable company.
Where that company had bought the gold from, he could not say.
The criminal case had been "stuck" for three years already, as there was no evidence to support the accusations, said Gombergs.
On the other hand, the Estonian Tax and Customs Board's spokeswoman Mailin Aasmae told the television that the Estonian prosecutor's office and Tax and Customs Board suspected that Gombergs' trade in gold had violated the country's tax laws.
Gombergs owns a number of properties in Riga and Jurmala. He is known for the restoration of various Russian Empire monuments in Riga, including monuments to Peter I and Barclay de Tolly, as well as the monument to the Britain-born Riga Mayor George Armitstead.
Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Greens/Farmers) said earlier that working out a new strategy for the Revenue Service would be one of Cirule's most important tasks.

Chelsea Manning asks Obama for reduced sentence: report New York, Nov 14, 2016 (AFP) - Imprisoned transgender soldier Chelsea Manning, who is serving 35 years behind bars for leaking classified US documents, has asked President Barack Obama to reduce her sentence before he leaves office, reports said.
Originally called Bradley, Manning was convicted in August 2013 of espionage and other offenses after admitting to handing classified documents to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.
"The sole relief I am asking for is to be released from military prison after serving six years of confinement as a person who did not intend to harm the interests of the United States or harm any service members," she said.
While hailed by supporters as a hero for exposing what they see as US abuses in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Manning has been denounced by prosecutors as a traitor who put country and comrades at risk.

From a guy like that with a lot of experience, there’s a lot to learn.
I hope I have that chance.”

The group called The True Religion (Die wahre Religion) is now also banned, Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said.
"Under the pretext of promoting Islam, under the pretext of supposedly harmless distribution of translated versions of the Koran that took place in pedestrian zones, hate messages were propagated and young people radicalised," added the interior minister.
De Maiziere noted that after participating in the Koran distribution campaign organised by the group, "140 young people travelled to Syria and Iraq where they joined the fight with terrorist groups".
Experts say the German translation of the Koran distributed by the group is a particularly strict version from the original Arabic text.
De Maiziere stressed that Tuesday's action is not targeted against the general distribution of translated Korans, but against those who "abuse religion and who use it as a pretext to spread extremist ideology and to back terrorist organisations".
Almost a third have returned and 140 were killed while abroad, while around 420 are still in Syria or Iraq.

Aleksandrs Gaponenko, an activist of the unregistered NGO Congress of Non-citizens, who featured as the only expert in the NTV story, claimed that the torchlight processions in Riga were financed from the government budget.
"That means that the state authorities have recognized the worship of fire, torchlight processions and the chants "Latvia for Latvians" as an official religion," Gaponenko said.
A number of torchlight processions took place in Riga on Lacplesis Day last Friday, November 11, but their organizers deny the claims made on the NTV program.
"We have no budget whatsoever, people joined the procession with their own torches," Latvijas Avize quoted Rolands Fedotovs, the organizer of a student procession, as saying.
The council has therefore launched a probe to gather all the relevant materials and documents to prepare a complaint, which will be filed with British telecommunications regulator OFCOM, because NTV is registered in the UK.

But Snowden questioned if that policy could be modified by new officials "who have a very different set of values and can govern in the dark ."

"This is kind of the challenge that we're facing today in the United States with the result of the last election ."

Since the highly infectious virus detected in central Europe is "very similar" to that detected in Russia, it was safe to assume that it arrived via wild birds, he said.
Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Hungary, Denmark and Austria have all confirmed cases of the virus, which was first isolated from migratory waterfowl in South Korea in 2014. It has been found in European domestic fowl flocks since November 2014, and led to massive culling.
German federal and state authorities are meeting on Tuesday in a bid to coordidate efforts to stop the spread of the virus.

NATO will remain "bedrock" of security, Stoltenberg says Brussels (dpa) - NATO will continue to provide a "bedrock" of security, alliance chief Jens Stoltenberg predicted Tuesday, playing down warnings by US president-elect Donald Trump that Washington may scale back its role unless European allies increase defence spending.
But Stoltenberg played down the concerns, noting that Trump's call echoed the demand of current and previous US? leaders that European allies invest more in defence.
"I am absolutely certain that NATO will continue to be the bedrock of our security,"? the NATO? chief said ahead of a meeting with EU? defence ministers in Brussels.
"In times with uncertainty as we live in now, with the turmoil, the violence we see in Iraq, Syria, but also a more assertive Russia in the East, NATO is as important as ever," he added.
"The disagreements highlight the dilemma faced by Trump, who is now torn between a campaign promise to shake up Washington and the need to build a national security team with policy experience," the report said.
Among those mentioned as possible secretary of state are hawkish former diplomat John Bolton and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani.
Retired General Michael Flynn "is a possible national security adviser pick, and Senator Jeff Sessions may be in the running for secretary of defense or attorney general," CNN added.
Trump was due to meet with Vice President-elect Mike Pence on Tuesday, transition officials said, fueling speculation that cabinet and other major announcements are imminent.
Italy polls get worse for Renzi as referendum nears ROME Opinion polls are making increasingly grim reading for Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi less than three weeks ahead of a referendum on constitutional reform on which he has staked his political future.
In three polls published on Monday the lead for'No 'ranged from five points, according to IPR Marketing, to seven points, according to Tecne, with EMG Acqua in the middle at 6 points.
The surveys are so one-way that attention is turning to what Renzi will do if he loses the vote on his plan to drastically reduce the role of the upper house Senate and take powers back from regional governments. At the start of the campaign he repeatedly said he would resign in the case of defeat.
He then declined to confirm that, saying discussion of his own future deflected attention from the merits of the reform, but in the last few days he has once more began hinting that he will not try to hang on in power if he loses.
However, most pollsters continue to say the outcome of the Dec. 4. ballot remains uncertain.
One is that the polls show that the'No 'vote is strongest in the south of the country, where turnout is normally lowest.
"It may be that a significant number of those in the south who say they are going to vote'No 'will end up staying at home," said Federico Benini, head of the Winpoll agency.
Benini forecast that of those that cast a ballot, up to 80 percent will back'Yes' because they follow Italian politics less closely, tend to be less anti-Renzi and see it as broadly positive that the country is trying to reform.
Another factor that could save Renzi is the wording of the question on the ballot sheet, which has been the subject of bitter dispute and legal cases because it mentions the more popular aspects of the reform but not the less positive ones.
Moreover, in a Winpoll survey published on Saturday, 52 percent of Italians said they believed Trump's victory would favor'No ', compared with 42 percent who thought it would have no impact, and just 6 percent who said it would help'Yes'.
The final polls will be issued on Friday, as Italian law prohibits their publication in the 15 days before an election or referendum.

Footage broadcast on Israeli television shows Medvedev enjoying himself flying the drone with its remote control.
Medvedev accepted the gift -- but it was not clear whether Ariel was allowed to give it away.
The drone was made by Spanish company Alpha Unmanned Systems, while its thermal camera was from US company Flir, the Jerusalem Post reported.
Haaretz newspaper reported that staff at the Volcani Centre, which carries out agricultural research, had so far refused to give the components away.
The ministry will quickly purchase a new drone to replace it, the statement said -- though some pointed out that this would have to come at taxpayers' expense.
The Movement for Quality Government in Israel called for Ariel to pay for the drone from his own pocket.
Nachman Shai of the opposition Zionist Union said the minister from the far-right Jewish Home had been duped into handing "knowledge and technologies to the wrong countries".
The Volcani Centre and Israel's foreign ministry refused to comment.

US may have committed war crimes in Afghanistan: ICC prosecutor The Hague, Nov 14, 2016 (AFP) - US military forces and the CIA may have committed war crimes in Afghanistan through the "cruel and violent" interrogation of detainees mostly between 2003-2004, the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court said Monday.
There was a "reasonable basis to believe that, in the course of interrogating these detainees... members of the US armed forces and the US Central Intelligence Agency resorted to techniques amounting to the commission of the war crimes of torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, and rape," chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said, unveiling the results of a preliminary probe.
Dennis, who founded McLaren and has been instrumental in their success in Formula One, will be told by fellow shareholders today that he must give up his roles with the organization after a high court bid to prevent him being moved to gardening leave failed last week.
McLaren have become the second most successful team in Formula One behind Ferrari during Dennis’ tenure, and he is directly responsible for bringing in talent such as Aryton Senna, Mika Hakkinen and Lewis Hamilton who have continued to build McLaren’s legacy on the track. However issues behind the scenes have caused some tension and finally it seems that something has to go.

Not possible to completely contain contraband - Customs Administration deputy head RIGA, Nov 15 (LETA) - In an interview on Latvian Radio this morning, the deputy chief of the Customs Administration Raimonds Zukuls said that it is not possible to completely contain contraband from entering the country.
''There is no country where contraband has been completely contained, just as there is no country where there is no crime.
In the first nine months of the year, there has been a 27.7 percent increase in the number of contraband or illegal smuggling instances registered, according to the State Revenue Service.
A Paris commercial court ruled on Monday that "the interruption of transmission... was a clear violation" and provoked "obviously illicit trouble" for the Swedish company, Stiftelsen Kurdish Media (SKM), which broadcasts Newroz.
"They shut our news channel without evidence; that should not happen in Europe," Faruk Nozhatzadeh, head of Newroz TV, told AFP.
"In the countries we come from, these things happen every day... but in Europe it was shocking that Eutelsat took such a decision ."
Eutelsat took Newroz off air on October 11 at the behest of the Turkish audiovisual authority (RTUK), which accuses the station of having links with the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), an organisation branded terrorists by Turkey, the European Union and the United States of America.
But the court said that other than making "a simple claim", RTUK had not only failed to prove any links between Newroz and the PKK.
"One is easily labelled over terrorism and propaganda but I do n't think we have a propaganda channel," said Nozhatzadeh, whose station transmits from a Stockholm suburb.
"We have shown the reality like all the other news channels.
We have followed all the laws in Sweden ."
Nozhatzadeh denied his station had any connections to the PKK but said "we support all Kurdish (political) parties" although "that does n't mean that we have connections" to them.
The other three partnerships bring together Finland and Iceland; Israel and Lithuania; and Romania and Hungary.
"We are extremely happy to have created a platform for the sports fans of the two nations where basketball lovers can experience unique basketball jubilation.

Likewise, we fully believe that the enthusiastic Turkish audience would fill the games if they were being played in Russia ."
Formula One: Alonso warns Vettel over track behaviour Sao Paulo, Nov 13, 2016 (AFP) - Fernando Alonso threatened on Sunday to deliberately drive into Sebastian Vettel next time they are competing to teach him a lesson about his on-track conduct.
The McLaren-Honda driver and the four-time champion Ferrari racer were fighting for seventh position when Vettel attempted to pass Alonso on the inside at Turn 11.
Alonso said he was forced off the circuit by Vettel and had to run off to avoid contact and thereby conceded a position.
"There was an asphalt run-off and I used it and nothing happened, but if there's a wall there, I either drive into the wall or into him, which is what I will probably do next time," raged Alonso.
"I'll crash into him and he will lose more points than me ."
Phil Jackson is, of course, a president of a different kind. He's in control of the New York Knicks and fully endorses the notion that if his platform does n't pan out, he will assume responsibility.
"I do n't care about the triangle.
They have a role, but they might not feel like they are involved and I like to see all five players being involved in the game.
That was definitely a slap in the face.
What I really want to see him do is develop his game.
It changes the game in many ways.
But he needs to learn how to use his size appropriately in different ways because teams will switch and defend with smaller players.
With his back to the basket, he has n't learned how to do all the positioning and to hold his space.
PJ: He has a learner's mind. I followed this guy since he went to Iowa State.
When he came to the pros I wondered, 'Would he have enough athletic talent? '
I like the way he talks to young players.

She stressed that the Taliban militia and the affiliated Haqqani network, Afghan government forces and US troops as well as the CIA all appeared to have carried out war crimes since the Islamic militia was ousted by a US-led invasion in 2001.
But the United States has not ratified the court's founding Rome Statute, and it is unlikely Washington would cooperate in any investigation which would expose US forces for the first time to the glare of an ICC probe.

British prison officers strike over system'in meltdown' London, Nov 15, 2016 (AFP) - Thousands of British prison officers have stopped working in protest over a system "in meltdown", union leaders said Tuesday, prompting the government to take legal action to force them back on duty.
Britain's largest prisons union, the Prison Officers Association (POA), directed its members to take part in the action over what it described as the "volatile and dangerous state of prisons".
Justice minister Liz Truss said the government was seeking legal redress over the matter, since prison officers in Britain are technically banned from going on strike.
"The union's position is unnecessary and unlawful and it will make the situation in our prisons more dangerous," Truss told MPs in the House of Commons.
The government has appealed to the High Court for an injunction to block the action, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) confirmed.
Incidents of violence, self harm and deaths in custody have been "steadily rising", reaching "totally unacceptable" levels, he told AFP.

Constitutional Court upholds legal provision on company board members' responsibility for company's late tax payments RIGA, Nov 15 (LETA) - The Constitutional Court ruled today that a provision in the Law on Taxes and Fees, which stipulates that a company's board members can be held responsible for the company's late tax payments, does not go against the Constitution.
The Constitutional Court's ruling can not be appealed, as Lina Kovalevska, aide to the Constitutional Court's chairman, told LETA.
Finally, the petition says that the legislation violates the presumption of innocence and therefore contradicts Article 92 of the Constitution, as members of a company's board are to be held responsible should the company be late with its tax payments, and have a duty to prove their innocence.
The Constitutional Court found, however, that the disputed legal provision was not disproportionate and did not contradict the Constitution.
US blacklists Crimea's representatives to Russian parliament Washington, Nov 14, 2016 (AFP) - The United States added six Crimean representatives newly elected to Russia's parliament to its sanctions blacklist Monday for their part in supporting Moscow's illegal 2014 annexation of the Ukrainian territory.

They were complicit in policies "that threaten the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of Ukraine," it said.
The sanctions ban Americans and US entities from dealings with the six, which effectively tightly restricts their access to the international financial system.

But Aspas gave the visitors hope in the 89th minute and Isco equalized deep in stoppage time with virtually the last kick of the game.
It was the final game for England interim manager Gareth Southgate, who went unbeaten in four games after replacing Sam Allardyce in September, with the Football Association to decide on who gets the job permanently.

The building will be constructed in third rounds.
Democrats in US Senate choose new leader; no change for Republicans Washington (dpa) - Democrats in the US Senate on Wednesday chose a new leader, while Republicans decided to keep the one they have.
The chamber's Democrats, who make up the minority, selected New York Senator Chuck Schumer to replace retiring Senator Harry Reid as leader.
McConnell, 74, has served as Senate majority leader since 2015.
But, when the new Senate convenes in January, he will serve as one of the new president's key partners in Congress.
Republicans in the House of Representatives on Tuesday nominated Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin to continue serving as speaker.
Representative Nancy Pelosi of California has served as the top Democrat in the House since 2002.
Whether she will keep the post is unknown.
The system, which the bloc's executive European Commission is expected to back on Wednesday, would check people's identity documents and residence details against a variety of EU security and crime databases.
Following Islamic State attacks in France and Belgium and the chaotic mass arrival of migrants and refugees in Greece, the executive hopes screening can close loopholes at its borders for violent militants, criminals and would-be illegal immigrants.
It would affect citizens of around 60 countries who can visit Europe's Schengen area for short trips without first applying for a visa, including Americans, Japanese and -depending on what arrangements London negotiates for leaving the EU - potentially Britons too.
The Commission estimates its set-up costs at around 200 million euros and annual running costs at 85 million.
It would also address European concerns over plans to expand visa-free travel in the coming years to two big neighbors, Turkey and Ukraine, and would apply immediately to people from non-EU states in the Balkans such as Albania and Serbia.
EU officials hope it could be up and running after legislative approval by early next decade.
Austria pushes for brake on child benefits paid abroad The Local Austrian ministers say they will push the EU Commission to apply emergency measures to reduce the amount of child benefit payments paid to EU migrants with children living outside of Austria.
Figures show that the amount of child benefit paid in 2013 to the children of EU migrants living outside Austria was around €192 million.
In a letter to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, the three Austrian ministers call for child benefits to be scaled according to the cost of living in the EU member state where the child resides.
They say that Austrian families are being “discriminated against” as the child benefit payment covers about half of their monthly costs whereas for some parents with children in other member states the benefit payment allows them to live very comfortably.
The ministers want Brussels to impose an emergency brake on child benefits paid abroad, which they say would enable them to increase the amount paid to families living in Austria.
The group of inmates who have been released include women, young men and prisoners who are ill, Granma said.

New deal with FARC rebels is final, Colombian government says Bogota (dpa) - The new peace agreement which the Colombian government and the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) announced last week is final, the Colombian government said Tuesday.
The only thing still to be discussed was how the agreement, which was unveiled Saturday, will be ratified, said the government's head negotiator,? Humberto de la Calle.
"There is really no room for new negotiations," De la Calle said.
"They accepted a number of things that are not easy for a guerrilla to accept," Jaramillo said.
The Colombian government and FARC said last week that modifications were accepted for 56 topics - all except one that would ban rebels from engaging in politics or holding an elected office once the agreement is implemented.
Experts regard a second referendum as unlikely and believe instead that the new deal will be put to a vote in Congress, where the ruling centre-right coalition National Unity has a majority.
Court to look into Madona local government's decision to merge Madona high schools RIGA, Nov 16 (LETA) - The Administrative District Court will look into Madona residents' appeal against the local government's decision to merge Madona 1st and 2nd high schools, attorney at law Janis Avotins told LETA.
Even though there have been a lot of complaints about school reorganization across Latvia, Madona schoolchildren's parents have achieved that, for the first time in history of administrative courts in Latvia, a case has been opened to assess the local government's decision on reorganization of local schools, said Avotins.
Several parents of children attending Madona high schools No. 1 and 2 last month turned to the Administrative District Court, asking the court to overturn Madona Region Council's decision of March 31 to reorganize the two schools by merging them.
At the end of November, the court decided to suspend the local government's decision. A public hearing has been scheduled for November 25.
Madona Region Council previously decided to create one Madona High School through merging high schools # 1 and # 2.

Dijsselbloem was reacting to an interview by Boris Johnson with Czech daily Hospodarske noviny in which the British foreign minister reportedly said Britain would "probably" have to leave the European customs union but still have "free trade" with EU states.
"He's saying things that are intellectually impossible, politically unavailable," Dijsselbloem, who is the Dutch finance minister and head of the eurozone, told the BBC's Newsnight programme on Tuesday.
"I think he's not offering the British people a fair view of what is available and what can be achieved in these negotiations," he said.
The European Union's customs union is a free trade area between member states that imposes a common external tariff on all goods entering the EU.
Turkey, which is not a member state, is also in a customs union with the EU with some exceptions.
Britain's departure would be "a step back," he said, adding: "The UK will be outside the internal market and there will be some hindrances".
It's going to be a lose-lose situation and in the best case if we set aside all emotions and try to reach an agreement that is least damaging to both of us we can minimise the damages.
"We can do our best to minimise damages but it's going to be a step back and that is what Boris Johnson should start talking about," he said.
Polish parliament passes bill to lower retirement age Warsaw (dpa) - Poland's lower house of parliament passed legislation Wednesday to lower the age of retirement from 67 to 60 for women and 65 for men, placing Poland at odds with a broader trend to raise the bar in other European countries.

The national-conservative government has hit back at criticism, arguing that people can work longer if they want to.
Terrorism deaths in OECD countries increase sixfold in single year London (dpa) - The number of deaths caused by terrorism increased more than sixfold in developed countries in 2015, as attacks orchestrated or inspired by the extremist group Islamic State spread across the world, according to the Global Terrorism Index (GTI).
While military intervention against Islamic State and Boko Haram resulted in a 32-per-cent reduction in terrorism-related deaths in Iraq and Nigeria, GTI data showed that such deaths in OECD countries rose from 77 in 2014 to 577 in 2015.
Steve Killelea, Executive Chairman of Institute for Economics and Peace, points to a pattern in the profile of the fighters from developed countries joining Islamic State who pose such a threat to many OECD countries: they are highly educated but have low incomes and often feel excluded in their home countries.
The World Service started out in 1932 as a radio channel for English speakers in the British empire, but has morphed over the decades into a highly respected global provider of news and quality programs in English and dozens of other languages.

Obama urges'course correction 'on globalisation Athens, Nov 16, 2016 (AFP) - Globalisation has brought many economic benefits to the world but needs a "course correction" to address growing inequality, US President Barack Obama said Wednesday on his European farewell tour.
"The global path of globalisation demands a course correction," Obama said in an eagerly-awaited speech in Athens, before continuing his journey to Berlin.
"When we see people, global elites, wealthy corporations seemingly living by a different set of rules, avoiding taxes, manipulating loopholes... this feeds a profound sense of injustice," he added.
During the trip, the outgoing president has repeatedly referred to the anger that lately brought success to populist movements in Europe and the United States, such as the Brexit referendum and Trump's shock victory last week.
In comments Tuesday Obama cautioned the world must guard against "a rise in a crude sort of nationalism or ethnic identity or tribalism that is built around an'us' and a'them '".
Following his speech, the president will head to Germany to visit Chancellor Angela Merkel, whom he has described as "probably... my closest international partner these last eight years ."
US senator pushes to abolish electoral college after Trump win Washington, Nov 16, 2016 (AFP) - A California senator introduced legislation Tuesday to rid the United States of its electoral college, the system that allowed Donald Trump to win the presidency despite Hillary Clinton's lead of nearly one million votes.
"This is the only office in the land where you can get more votes and still lose the presidency," said Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer, who introduced the measure.
"The electoral college is an outdated, undemocratic system that does not reflect our modern society, and it needs to change immediately.
Every American should be guaranteed that their vote counts," Boxer said.
More than 4.3 million people have signed a petition on the change.org website asking the college's 538 electors to elect Clinton on December 19, when their votes will be officially counted.
Trump himself had strongly criticized the electoral college in 2012 calling it a "disaster ." On Tuesday, however, he changed his tune.
"The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play.

It’s obvious that doesn’t make any sense whatsoever.” “There’s lots of chaos and we don’t understand what the position is, ” Calenda said.
“It’s all becoming an internal U.K. debate, which is not OK.” The British government “needs to sit down, put its cards on the table and negotiate, ” he said.

"I was a bit surprised, because I had n't meant that at all," Mueller told German broadcaster ARD.
"The reader often reads only the headline and then makes an impression, which I had once again underestimated ."
"It was taken out of context by some media, which seems to have given some people the wrong impression, influenced by a sometimes humorous social media post by a former official of the San Marino Football Association.
"I will continue to express my opinion in the future, even if I run the risk of getting a few flies buzzing around my ears," added the 27-year-old.

If the crime of public defamation of the president were reinstated, the criminal code would start to be used in the political fight, Sobotka, CSSD chairman, said.
He said the president undoubtedly deserves respect, but that the proposed bill is "pointless and risky ."
"I view any similar efforts aiming to restrict the freedom of speech, and thereby also the fundamental democratic values in our society, as inappropriate," Sobotka said.
He said the proposal runs counter to the European Court of Human Rights verdicts.
"The Strasbourg-based court has repeatedly said that a public official, namely a high-ranking politician, has to bear more criticism than ordinary people.
Even a sharp criticism of a politician in power is a part of democracy, and it is inadmissible to use the criminal law to crack down on it.
The Czech Constitutional Court has made a similar statement as well," Sobotka wrote in a press release.
"I learnt about it from the media," he said.
Under the Communist regime, the defamation of the country and its representatives was punished by up to two years in prison.
President Milos Zeman will not enter the debate in any way, his spokesman Ovcacek has said.
The military base is planned to be established in the Karosta neighborhood and the surrounding area.

The Latvian parliamentary committee on legal affairs earlier today approved removing from the proposed amendments to the Insolvency Law a provision which stipulates that insolvency administrators have the status of a public official.

UK govt drops plans to curb power of Lords London, Nov 17, 2016 (AFP) - The British government said Thursday it has dropped plans to curb the power of the unelected House of Lords, which it had been considering following an embarrassing policy defeat.
Responding to the report on Thursday, Commons leader David Lidington said the report was "compelling" and "we are determined that the principle of the supremacy of the elected House should be upheld".
But he said "we have no plans for now to introduce new primary legislation" to enact reforms.
The decision reflects conclusions of the Commons constitutional affairs committee, which said in May that Strathclyde's proposals would be an "overreaction and entirely disproportionate".
It noted that the House of Lords -- made up of 812 religious leaders, hereditary and appointed members -- had only used its right to block secondary legislation five times in the past 50 years.
Former business leader and independent peer Digby Jones said the decision by Prime Minister Theresa May to back down on reforms considered by her predecessor David Cameron was a "big mistake".
"I think they're going to live to regret it on all of the Brexit stuff coming down the pipe," he told the BBC. ar/dt/pvh

De Blasio -- along with the mayors of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia and the US capital Washington -- has declared his city a "sanctuary" for immigrants, vowing to protect the undocumented from deportation and extend public services regardless of their legal status.
Following Trump's election, de Blasio said the city would delete from its database the names of hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who have received a city ID card, to stop the incoming administration from identifying or deporting them.
- Mayors'welcome the fight '- During the campaign de Blasio described the Republican candidate as "dangerous" and unqualified to lead the country.
Trump, in turn, has called de Blasio "the worst mayor" in the United States.
"There wo n't be prime ministry in the new system," he told the state-run news agency Anadolu.
"In general there is a president and next to him probably a vice president like in the United States.
We might have more than one vice president," he said.
His ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) needs at least 330 votes in the 550-seat parliament to call a referendum to legislate the changes.
Eroglu predicted that the proposed package would be put to a referendum next spring with the support of MPs from the opposition Nationalist Movement Party (MHP).
"What's being thought is a system where the legislative and executive run separately," he said.
Erdoglu added that the president would be party-affiliated, meaning Erdogan could resume his links with the ruling AKP that he had to cut after becoming president.

Intelligence officials have also pointed to Russian support for eurosceptic, anti-immigrant parties in Germany and across the EU.
"This could happen again next year and we are alarmed," Maassen told Reuters in an interview late on Tuesday.
"We have the impression that this is part of a hybrid threat that seeks to influence public opinion and decision-making processes ."
He said it was important to publicly expose such campaigns.
"When people realize that the information that they are getting is not true..., then the toxic lies lose their effectiveness ."
Russian officials have denied all accusations of manipulation and interference intended to weaken the EU.
"Russia withdrew from the International Criminal Court... Maybe they thought it was useless.
They withdrew their membership.
Duterte noted that despite the ICC's existence, many children and women are still being killed in bombings, and human rights abuses happen around the world.
"Let me be clear: Any person in the Philippines who incites or engages in acts of mass violence including by ordering, requesting, encouraging or contributing... to the commission of crimes within the jurisdiction of the ICC is potentially liable for prosecution before the court," he said.
Last month, Gambia, Burundi and South Africa announced their decision to leave the ICC.
The United States also does not recognize the court.
Latvian residents believes that corruption is one of the main problems in the country, as 71 percent of residents believe that the government is doing a poor job in fighting corruption.
15 percent of Latvian households also revealed that they have paid a bribe within the past year to receive basic services.
This figure is more than in Estonia (five percent), but less than in Lithuania (24 percent), as well as three other EU countries - Romania (29 percent), Hungary (22 percent), and Bulgaria (17 percent).

Parliament had been due to vote on the ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.
It was adopted by the Strasbourg-based Council of Europe rights body in 2011 and has been ratified by more than 20 states.
But the former Soviet republic remains a deeply conservative country where Gay Pride parades are often either banned or met with violence from far-right thugs.
Work on the first draft of Ukraine's legislation was delayed and from now on will include members of the conservative Council of Churches.
"I agree that we must accept many European values - but certainly not the ones that violate the bases of Christianity," said Yuriy Solovey of the Petro Poroshenko Bloc party.
Parliament has not yet scheduled a new hearing and no timeframe for any version of the convention's ratification has been set.
It remains unclear how the Council of Europe will respond if Ukraine eventually ratifies a far more conservative version of the convention that omits some of its basic principles.
"I have always been strongly engaged for a conclusion of a trade deal with the United States.

Merkel acknowledged that "globalisation... needs to be given a human face" but she stressed that the world must not fall back into pre-globalisation times.
The raids in southern Germany and Poland unearthed the thousands of discs and albums.
The sale of the pirated content could have robbed the rightful producers of millions of euros, said prosecutors in Stuttgart.

In Germany, such discs still account for 60 per cent of the market.
Authorities became aware of the crime ring after cooperating with the BVMI.
Investigations began in 2015, with the first raids earlier this year.

Vejonis notes lack of courage to take action in current politics RIGA, Nov 17 (LETA) - There is not enough courage to take action in the current politics, President Raimonds Vejonis says in an interview with newspaper Diena today.
"It is very obvious that, as soon as there are delays with access to EU funds, our gross domestic product growth falters.
It means that we actually do not have our own economy," says Vejonis.
"I believe that this is not right in the long run - the support provided by EU funds is to help us catch up with other countries, but at the same time it must not be the main source of income for the Latvian economy," he emphasizes.
The president indicates that now politicians are ready to start changes in healthcare and education, as problems in these two sectors were being discussed for way too long.
"When we take decisions, there can be some mistakes, but these mistakes can then be analyzed and corrected. On the other hand, the endless talk that we have to create an ideal model first, and only then change something, is not taking us anywhere, it's a vicious circle," believes Vejonis.
"People have to be ready to change something, and get actively involved in politics, contributing new ideas and proposals ."
When asked why poorly thought-out decisions happen, Vejonis explains that there is no overarching vision of what has to be attained.

European leaders and Obama to discuss Russia sanctions in Berlin: sources European leaders and President Barack Obama will discuss on Friday an extension of the sanctions imposed on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine, as well as possible new sanctions for its bombing in Syria, multiple sources familiar with the plans said.
European leaders will therefore be seeking clarity from Obama, who met with Trump at the White House for over an hour last week.
"We're in a really critical situation," said the German official.
"We have to prevent a situation where the EU rolls over the sanctions and then the new U.S. president comes in and lifts them ."
After his meeting with Trump, Obama sought to reassure U.S. allies that the president-elect would maintain core relationships around the world, including with NATO.
European officials fear that Russia will use the time before Trump's inauguration to launch new offensives in Syria and Ukraine.
"Syria will definitely be on the agenda," said one of the sources, citing coordinated Russian missile strikes against rebels in Syria launched on Tuesday from an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean.

One-third of people living in Europe and Central Asia think corruption is one of the biggest problems facing their country - report RIGA, Nov 17 (LETA) - One in three people living in Europe and Central Asia think corruption is one of the biggest problems facing their country, says Transparency International's latest report.
Nearly a third of citizens across the region believe that their government officials and lawmakers are highly corrupt and a majority of people say their governments are not doing enough to stop corruption.
Over half the people in European Union countries (53 percent), EU accession candidate countries (53 percent) and Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), mainly former Soviet Union countries, (56 percent) said their governments had failed to curb corruption.
The governments of Ukraine (86 percent), Moldova (84 percent), Bosnia and Herzegovina (82 percent), and Spain (80 percent) were judged worst by their citizens.
In the richest countries, almost two out of three people (65 percent) believed the wealthy have too much influence on policy compared to 44 percent in the EU accession countries and 46 percent in CIS countries.
One key stumbling block to fighting corruption is the lack of protection for those who speak up against it.
30 percent of all those questioned across Europe and Central Asia said that the main reason more people do not report cases of corruption is because they fear the consequences.
Few citizens feel empowered to help stop corruption in their country: less than half of people (47 percent) in EU countries feel that they can make a difference in the fight against corruption, and this falls to less than a third (31 percent) in CIS countries.

Trump announces five-year ban on appointees working for lobbyists Washington (dpa) - US president-elect Donald Trump will ask all his appointees to sign a clause preventing them from working for lobbyists for five years after leaving his administration, his spokesman said on Wednesday.

Buffalo, NY (WGR 550) -- Zemgus Girgensons has 34 shots on goal this season and only one goal to show for it.
The former number one pick excelled under Ted Nolan scoring 15 goals in 61 games. Nolan didn’t really have much of a system and he allowed Girgensons just to go out and play.
He could react without thinking. Under Dan Bylsma, there’s a very structured system and Girgensons has struggled.
The centerman said, “It’s frustrating.
I’ve been struggling with the whole year, but the most important thing is us playing the right way.
We give teams too much against us and that limits us in the O-zone.” It seems when you ask the coach about it, Bylsma said Girgensons is still trying to learn what’s expected of him, “He’s still learning, but he’s a determined, hardworking guy.
Girgensons said, “These past couple of games have been close games until later in the game.

The three, from the Church's "progressive wing", may help counterbalance a strong conservative presence among US cardinals, particularly at a moment when the authority of reform-minded Francis is being challenged by US-led traditionalists.

For the Jubilee of Mercy, holy doors were opened not just in Rome, attracting more than 20 million pilgrims, but also across the globe.

Trump election: Mitt Romney considered for secretary of state US Vice-President-elect Mike Pence has confirmed that Mitt Romney is being considered for the post of secretary of state, among others.
The statement, in a Fox News interview, comes after President-elect Donald Trump met Mr Romney, a Republican who criticised him during the campaign.
Mr Romney - who ran an unsuccessful campaign against Barack Obama in 2012 - is under "active consideration" as secretary of state, Mr Pence told the Fox News Sunday programme.
"Prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished" if Mr Trump became the nominee, he said.
Mr Trump responded by mocking Mr Romney, calling him a "failed candidate" and a "choke artist".
The winner of the conservative primary seems assured to make the presidential run-off, where he or she is likely to face far-right leader Marine Le Pen.
Polls suggest that the Republican candidate would win that election.
Those taking part have to sign a statement saying that they "share the Republican values of the right and the centre".

Germany buys US house where Thomas Mann lived Germany has purchased the Californian property where writer Thomas Mann lived for a decade in exile from Nazi rule and hosted other cultural workers persecuted by the regime, the foreign ministry said on Friday.
Mann, one of Germany's most renowned writers, penned part of his 1947 novel "Doctor Faustus" in the house located in the ocean-front Pacific Palisades neighbourhood on the edge of Los Angeles.
"Thomas Mann's house was like the'White House for exiles'.
This was the home for many Germans who fought together for a better future for our country, who battled for an open society and helped built the foundations of common transatlantic values," said Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier in a statement.
Steinmeier said he hoped the site would help to contribute to transatlantic dialogue at a "stormy time, when we need more than ever cultural anchors with our most important partner outside Europe ."
"Some may criticise me but I express my opinion.
For example, I say'why should n't Turkey be in the Shanghai 5?," he said.
Other members are Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.
Erdogan said he had already discussed the idea with Russian President Vladimir Putin and with Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev.
Erdogan has several times floated plans for Turkey to join the SCO, a move that could scupper its long-standing EU membership bid.
Turkey formally applied to become an EU member in 1987 and accession talks only began in 2005, even though Ankara's aspirations to become part of the bloc dates back to the 1960s.
South Korea prosecutors say President Park was accomplice in corruption scandal South Korean prosecutors said on Sunday that they believed President Park Geun-hye was an accomplice in a corruption scandal that has rocked her administration, in a heavy blow to her fight for political survival.
Analysts said the prosecutors' comments about the president's involvement increased the prospect that she would face impeachment.
Park's lawyer Yoo Yeong-ha said the prosecutors' announcement was "deeply regrettable," according to South Korean media.
Park has been rocked by allegations that Choi used her ties to the president to meddle in state affairs and wield improper influence.
Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Seoul on Saturday in the fourth straight weekend of protests against Park, in the biggest public demonstrations the country has seen since the 1980s.
The first round of the presidential election was scheduled for October 9, but was delayed after devastating Hurricane Matthew pummeled the country on October 4.
Sunday's vote originally had been set for October 2015, but it was scrapped over claims of massive fraud.
An independent panel eventually agreed with the opposition that Moise's win was tainted by massive fraud and the poll results were thrown out -- creating a power vacuum when Martelly's mandate expired in February.
Any candidate who wins more than half of the votes cast on Sunday will be the victor. Otherwise, the runoff will go ahead as planned on January 29.

Erdogan demands support against PKK at NATO meeting Istanbul, Nov 21, 2016 (AFP) - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday urged the European Union and West to step up backing of Ankara's fight against Kurdish militants, as he addressed a meeting of NATO lawmakers.
"Those who have a hesitant attitude against terrorist organisations will be hit themselves sooner or later," he said in a speech to deputies at the NATO Parliamentary Assembly.
Erdogan had at the weekend mooted that Turkey could join the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a loose security and economic bloc led by Russia and China sometimes seen as an eastern counterpart to NATO.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg meanwhile emphasised the alliance's "solidarity" with Turkey in the wake of the coup and said Ankara "has the right" to prosecute those responsible.
He said he welcomed cooperation between Turkey and the Council of Europe over the legal measures after the coup, saying this should be an "important tool" to ensure the rule of law and human rights are applied.
Meanwhile, he added he wanted to see "more assurance measures" from NATO states to help Turkey on its unstable borders, in addition to the current surveillance flights and deployment of missile batteries on the Syrian frontier. sjw/ric

In doing so, he became the first Kings player to record the winning goal in three straight team games since Dec. 2-9, 2010 (Anze Kopitar).
He then made 31 saves in a 3-2 triumph over the Montreal Canadiens Nov. 18 and 28 saves in a 3-1 win over the Winnipeg Jets Nov. 20.

Construction quality has not changed substantially in past three years - Latvian Association of Civil Engineers RIGA, Nov 21 (LETA) - The quality of construction in Latvia has not changed substantially in the three years since the deadly collapse of a Maxima supermarket in Riga, Leonids Jakobsons, a representative of the Latvian Association of Civil Engineers, said in an interview with the 900 Seconds program of LNT commercial TV channel Monday.
"We have found ourselves in the situation where lawyers rather than specialists are dealing with project approval issues, and they basically focus on the projects' flaws and formalities, while safety issues receive less attention," Jakobsons said.
He also noted that the recently created State Construction Control Bureau has been working fairly busily, but a lot still remains to be done so that various issues in the construction sector could be solved in line with modern-day standards.
"The examination of construction professionals, which is currently being done by the State Construction Control Bureau, should be the responsibility of those institutions that supervise these specialists and issue the certificates," said Jakobsons. The State Construction Control Bureau, in his opinion, should oversee the process, but should not be involved in certification.
As reported, 54 people lost their lives and scores of others were injured when a Maxima supermarket collapsed in the neighborhood of Zolitude in Riga on November 21, 2013.
"I want to be respectful of the office and give the president-elect an opportunity to put forward his platform and his arguments without somebody popping off," Obama said, amid concerns about Trump's administration picks and public statements.
But, he said if there is something that "goes to core questions about our values and our ideals, and if I think that it's necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals then I'll examine it when it comes ." arb/bfm

French police foil terror attack, arrest 7: minister Paris, Nov 21, 2016 (AFP) - Police have broken up a terror ring plotting an attack in France after arresting seven suspects in Strasbourg and Marseille, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said on Monday.
"The threat of terrorism has never been so high on our soil," Cazeneuve said Monday. "Zero risk can not be guaranteed and anyone promising this is lying to the French people ."

Sweden rebuilds Cold War missile system from museums THE LOCAL Sweden has reconstituted its old Cold War anti-ship defence system, pulling launch trucks out of museums, in its latest move to improve its defences on the island of Gotland.
The Kustrobotbatteri 90 was the only land-based launcher ever developed for the Saab Robotsystem 15 (RBS-15) anti-ship missiles, but only one of the four planned batteries was ever delivered before the coastal artillery was disbanded in 2000.
The RBS-15 missiles were launched from Scania trucks, several of which have now been recovered from museums.
“This decision is national, but it is also a contribution by Sweden to the international defence capability in the Baltic Sea after Russia's annexation of Crimea and the invasion of Ukraine, ” he said.
“But we would still be involved in any conflict in the Baltic Sea area related to EU countries.” By the time of the Cold War’s end in 1991, Sweden had developed a coastal defence system protecting its islands, harbours and shipping lanes.
Defence minister Peter Hultqvist on Friday visited the test site on Sweden's east coast to see the reconstituted system tried out for the first time.
"I have had some good talks that make me believe it is possible," Rasmussen told news agency Ritzau.
Rasmussen's centre-right Venstre party holds only 34 out of 179 seats in parliament and needs the support of the anti-immigration Danish People's Party (DPP), the libertarian-leaning Liberal Alliance and the Conservative People's Party to govern.
The Liberal Alliance has threatened to topple the government unless it cuts the top income tax bracket by five percentage points by the end of the year.
Rasmussen's government took office in June 2015 and has sparked controversy by scaling back social benefits and reducing the country's generous education budget.
It has also introduced several measures to limit the number of migrants coming to the country, most of which were backed by the largest opposition party, the Social Democrats.

In the second one, 60 million people were killed.

In a manifesto published on Saturday, senior conservatives including former EU agriculture commissioner Franz Fischler and ex-vice chancellor Wilhelm Molterer, both from the People's Party (OeVP), said the next president must be "dependable".
To protect its economic vitality, "Austria must remain a trustworthy European and international partner," they wrote.
The manifesto offered support for Hofer's liberal rival, the independent ecologist Alexander Van der Bellen.
"We do not want to be faced with speculation about Austria leaving the European Union nor with attempts to hide the cornflower behind a crucifix," the declaration said, referring to a recent controversy.
The 45-year-old has been accused by Christian groups of manipulation after he added the phrase "So help me God" to his campaign posters.
Austria's president must be a guarantor of co-existence and "that is incompatible with speeches about fear, hate and the constant search for scapegoats," the manifesto said.
Opinon polls suggest the outcome of the re-run is too close to call. phs/hmw/ri
MPs still do not plan in the long term when new laws or regulations are adopted - Endzins RIGA, Nov 21 (LETA) - Latvia's politicians still do not plan in the long term when new laws and regulations are adopted, as Aivars Endzins, head of the Commission for Legal Environment Improvement established by President Raimonds Vejonis, said in an interview with the LNT television today.
Vejonis has every reason to be concerned about several conceptually-important amendments being submitted to Saeima when the law or regulation being amended is to be reviewed in the third, final reading.
"Measure twice and cut once," said Endzins.
The overall legal environment of Latvia is weakened, and as a result foreign investors show little interest about investing in Latvia, plus there are quite many international legal disputes that Latvia has lost, added Endzins.
1ST LEAD; Sources: SPD to announce Merkel challenger in January as planned; By Friederike Heine, dpa Berlin (dpa)? - German Chancellor Angela Merkel's centre-left Social? Democrat (SPD) rivals will announce their candidate for the chancellorship in January, despite pressure to respond to Merkel's decision to run for a fourth term.
Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel - who also serves as Merkel's deputy in Germany's grand coalition - is expected to run for office, though critics say he is not popular enough to unite the party behind him.
On Sunday Merkel made the long-awaited announcement that she would run for another four years in office as head of her centre-right Christian? Democrats (CDU).
If her party gets enough votes to form another government, she will be in line to become the longest-serving leader of any European country and one of the longest-serving leaders in German history.

"We want a majority (to the left of the CDU) - we want to lead this country ."
AfD? leader Frauke Petry welcomed Merkel's announcement, saying that she would look forward to running against a candidate "who caused the (extremely costly) and dangerous immigration chaos ."

Leave Trump's tweets alone: advisor Washington, Nov 21, 2016 (AFP) - President-elect Donald Trump's habit of firing off tweets, even at such critical times as when forming a new government, is a harmless and legitimate way to "cut through the noise," one of his top advisors said Monday.
Who is to say he ca n't do that, make a comment, spend five minutes on a tweet and making a comment and still be president-elect ?" Conway said.
"He has over 25 million followers on Facebook and Twitter and it's a great way for him to take his message directly to people and cut through the noise or silence," she told CNN, the latter referring to what she said was news organizations' failure to cover what Trump is actually getting done as he prepares to take power in January.

Polish president's autopsy shows earlier accounts false: report Polijas Radio New autopsies “clearly show” that the Polish presidential plane, which crashed in Smolensk in 2010, hit the ground wheels-first, and not upside down as earlier reports found, the daily Gazeta Polska Codziennie said on Saturday.
Autopsies were carried out on the late presidential couple, Lech and Maria Kaczyñski, who were on board the ill-fated plane, as part of a new investigation into the causes of the crash.

Raimonds Andrejevs, executive director of the organization uniting employers in the taxi industry, told journalists that ridesharing is a transformed and absurd type of taxi service, which will be significantly less regulated and will therefore leave the conventional taxi industry in a disadvantageous position, threatening its existence.
Under current legislation, all taxi services providers have to be licensed, but the requirement will not apply to ridesharing providers. As a result, the ridesharing segment will not be properly supervised and requirements for the drivers will be less strict.
In his words, the proposed regulation would leave the employers in control of the call-taxi platforms, while the drivers would lose their "legal jobs".
The employers' organization and the taxi drivers' union today signed a memorandum of understanding, pledging to protect their common interests on this issue and to submit their proposals to Saeima.
The taxi industry wants Saeima to scrap the draft amendments, but if their demands are not met, it is ready for "all forms of lawful protests".
On October 6, Saeima passed in the first reading draft amendments to the Road Transport Law that would allow for launching ridesharing services in Latvia.

The resolution calls for "holding inclusive Syrian talks without preconditions," Lavrov said.
"It seems there is no other way except for the patriotic opposition and the government to take the initiative into their own hands and organise Syrian dialogue," he said.

MEPs call for EU HQ to plan and command crisis management operations RIGA, Nov 22 (LETA) - Members of the European Parliament suggest creating multinational forces and an EU headquarters to plan and command crisis management operations, which would enable the bloc to respond to threats where NATO is reluctant to do so, the European Parliament's spokeswoman Signe Znotina-Znota told LETA.
According to a resolution passed by the European Parliament, the security situation in and around Europe has worsened significantly in recent years, due to challenges like terrorism, hybrid threats or cyber and energy insecurity, that no country is able to tackle alone.
The resolution also calls for closer EU-NATO cooperation, particularly in the east and the south, to countering hybrid and cyber threats, improve maritime security and develop defense capabilities.
However, the EU should also be prepared to act autonomously in cases where NATO is not willing to take the lead, MEPs add.
MEPs want the EU to respond faster and more robustly to real threats, which, they say, demand that Europe’s armed forces work together better.
The European Parliament passed the resolution on European Defense Union by 369 votes to 255, with 70 abstentions.

Egypt court overturns life sentence against ex-president Mursi Egypt's Court of Cassation overturned on Tuesday a life sentence against deposed President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood and ordered a retrial in the case that revolves around accusations of espionage with Palestinian group Hamas.
The court last week overturned a death sentence against Mursi in a separate case, meaning he no longer faces execution.
Democratically elected after the 2011 uprising, Mursi was overthrown in mid-2013 by Abdel Fattah al-Sisi following mass protests against his rule, and was immediately arrested.
Mursi was one of 22 high-ranking Muslim Brotherhood officials and supporters convicted last year of spying for fellow-Islamist group Hamas.
The government deems the Brotherhood, Egypt's oldest Islamist movement, a terrorist group.
Candidate for Latvia's next chief of defense not to change armed forces' development plans RIGA, Nov 22 (LETA) - The National Armed Forces' Joint Headquarters Commander, Major General Leonids Kalnins, recommended by Defense Minister Raimonds Bergmanis (Greens/Farmers) for Latvia's next chief of defense, aims to develop the armed forces' combat capabilities and does not intend to change the already existing plans for the armed forces' development.
Kalnins told journalists today that he had his own vision of the armed forces' development.
"There is only one vision - highly developed armed forces with robust combat capabilities, so that they can fulfill their main mission - to defend the Latvian state," Kalnins said.
The current security situation requires developing rapid response units, which involves the creation of new capabilities and units and redeployment of the existing units.
Major General Kalnins also noted that Latvia is preparing for hosting a Canada-led NATO battalion, and that it is therefore necessary to develop its functions as a host country, which involves the battalion's integration with the Latvian armed forces and synchronization of the training systems.
Major General Kalnins does not intend to change the armed forces' development plans which have been worked out with his participation.
"I have been working in a direct tandem with the outgoing chief of defense, and we have prepared plans for long-term development.
It would be surprising for me to say now that these plans, which I have worked out, should be changed," Kalnins said.
"The dispute has been going on for years, and the construction companies have lost count of their attempts to find a solution.
At the heart of the dispute is a provision in the contract for construction of the National Library building, which stipulates that cost items that make up the total contractual amount - labor costs, construction supplies and others - have to be corrected according to the Central Statistical Bureau's construction cost indices for every given period of time.
Furthermore, their appetite is incomprehensible - we were able to build the Gors concert hall in Rezekne for EUR 22 million.
This amount would be enough to ensure operations of all theaters and concert organizations in Latvia for one year.
The position of the state has not changed and will not change - we will not increase the contract amount, and we will not pay more than the original amount agreed upon in the contract.
We believe that the construction companies are making legally and financially impossible claims against the state, proposing to revise the contract retroactively.
The maximum contract amount is what the construction companies were proposing during the procurement procedure, and that was in 2008, when the prices were record-high," explains Culture Minister Dace Melbarde (National Alliance).
The Culture Ministry will act in accordance with the law and the contract, and prove its case in court, if necessary.
On the other hand, NBA argues that what it claims is not in excess of the amounts stipulated in contract on construction of the National Library, and that it only wants to be paid for the job it has done under the contract, so NBA could finally pay all the construction companies involved in building the National Library.

Strong 6.9 quake hits Japan, triggering Fukushima tsunami Tokyo, Nov 22, 2016 (Agence France-Presse) - A powerful 6.9-magnitude earthquake hit northeastern Japan on Tuesday triggering a one-metre (3.3-foot) tsunami wave that crashed into the coast at the stricken Fukushima nuclear power plant.
A massive undersea quake that hit in March 2011 sent a tsunami barrelling into the coast, leaving more than 18,500 people dead or missing, and sending three reactors into meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in one of the world's worst nuclear disasters.
The temporary stoppage was an automatic response, the Fukushima operator said.
The public broadcaster provided rolling coverage on the earthquake, with the words "Tsunami!
written in white lettering over a bright red band in the middle of the screen.
The vast majority of deaths in the 2011 disaster resulted from the tsunami.
Bite mobile operator to start installing 4.5G stations next year to ensure 1.4 Gbps download speed RIGA, Nov 22 (LETA) - Bite mobile operator, which today launched its first 4.5G base station at Domina Shopping mall in Riga, unveiled a plan to start installing such stations, which ensure up to 1.4 Gbps download speeds, also elsewhere in Latvia next year.
Bite Latvija commercial director Kaspars Buls told LETA that the first 4.5G station is a pilot project allowing to test the new technology over live network conditions.
We will start to install base stations elsewhere in Latvia at the beginning of next year when manufacturers promise to supply the first routers, cellphones and other devices supporting 4.5G speeds," said Buls.
He indicated that the 4.5G stations would be installed in the most densely populated areas requiring the highest network capacity, like large cities, as well as in venues of mass events and elsewhere.
Even if people still use handsets without 4.5G network support, the new stations will still help unburden the existing 4G network.
As reported, in October Bite announced plans to team up with Chinese tech giant Huawei to develop its 5G mobile network.
He said that a workgroup will be established soon to work on 4.5G and 5G in Latvia. "4.5G is the next step towards 5G.

Education and Science Employees' Union will ask Vejonis not to promulgate Education Law amendments if Saeima passes them tomorrow RIGA, Nov 22 (LETA) - Latvian Trade Union of Education and Science Employees will request President Raimonds Vejonis not to promulgate the so-called teacher loyalty amendments to the Education Law if Saeima passes the amendments tomorrow.
Should Saeima pass the controversial amendments to the Education Law on Wednesday, which stipulate, among other things, in which cases a person may not work as a teacher, the Education and Science Employees' Trade Union will turn to Vejonis, asking that the amendments be not promulgated, as the union's chairwoman Inga Vanaga told LETA.
The new version of the amendments, submitted by Education and Science Minister Karlis Sadurskis (Unity), has not been reviewed by Saeima Education, Culture and Science Committee, which did not support the original version of the amendments also.
Taking into account the new provisions that Sadurskis has included in the amendments, the legislation has to be discussed repeatedly, and the amendments therefore can not be promulgated by the president, said the union.
Sadurskis said the bill was likely to draw criticism from the opposition lawmakers also during the second reading in the parliament. The Education and Science Ministry said previously the purpose of the bill was to prevent risks to national and public interests, democracy, security and growth from illegal activities by teachers and school headmasters disloyal to Latvia.
Saeima, not State Chancellery, to decide reforms at Corruption Prevention Bureau - Krievins RIGA, Nov 22 (LETA) - Whether there is anything that has to be changed in supervision and structure of the Corruption Prevention Bureau is for Saeima to decide, not the State Chancellery, as the State Chancellery's Director Martins Krievins said in an interview with the LNT television this morning.
Furthermore, Saeima also appoints the head of the Corruption Prevention Bureau, and there is a special Saeima committee that deals with corruption prevention matters, said Krievins.
As reported, after all candidates for the Corruption Prevention Bureau's chief were turned down, Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis (Greens/Farmers) ordered the State Chancellery's director to submit his proposals concerning organization of the Corruption Prevention Bureau's operations and supervision of the bureau.
The new list of Latvia's TOP-100 millionaires, conclusions about this year's main economic trends and future forecasts will be presented to the media at a news conference in Riga on Thursday, November 24.
"The aggregate value of the ten richest people's assets has continued to grow (to EUR 1.74 billion this year from EUR 1.41 billion a year ago), but a drop in the assets of the remaining part of the TOP-100 compensates for this growth," said journalist Lato Lapsa, a co-author of the rich list.
He added that nearly all of the wealthiest families saw their businesses decline in value this year.
On the whole, however, the data suggest that this has been another year of stability.
Vadims Jerosenko, board chairman of corporate financial company Laika Stars, indicated that the value of banks depends not only on their financial results but also the situation in the region, which this time prompted cautiousness.
"The dynamic of many businesses has been negative this year as the financial results of last fiscal year reflected the impact of the geopolitical situation, and 2016 could not be regarded as a year of growth either," he said.
Explaining his reasons for picking Kalnins, Bergmanis said it was time for an experienced commander, who had risen from the ranks and served in different Armed Forces branches, to become the chief of defense.
One of the key criteria is that candidates for the job must have earned soldiers' respect and, taking into consideration that Land Force, including the Home Guard, is the key element of the Armed Forces, the candidate for the chief of defense had to come from this particular branch of the Armed Forces, Bergmains explained.
Taking into consideration the pending deployment of a NATO battalion to Latvia, the new chief of defense must be experienced in developing cooperation with foreign cooperation partners, on both the operational and practical levels.
At the same time, candidates for the top job have to have a clear vision of operational aspects of organization of national defense, attaining maximum effect with what resources available to the Armed Forces, and involving as many citizens of Latvia as possible in national defense, added Bergmanis.
According to the law, the chief of defense is nominated by the president, on the defense minister's recommendation, and appointed for a term of four years by Saeima.
Kalnins was appointed head of the Joint Headquarters on June 28 this year, taking office on August 26.
Kalnins has been serving in the Armed Forces since 1997, when he became a member of the Home Guard's 51st Battalion.
He was appointed head of the Reconnaissance Training Center in 2003, then served at the Training and Doctrine Command from 2003 to 2005, and as a senior officer at the Home Guard's Operative Planning Department from 2005 to 2011, when he was appointed commander of the Home Guard.
Kalnins is a graduate of the Baltic Defense College in Estonia and the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College.

Turkey: Mass dismissals from security forces, associations closed Istanbul (dpa) - A new wave of mass dismissals and shuttering of associations by decree hit Turkey on Tuesday, as the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced nearly 10,000 members of the security forces were affected.
By decree, 550 associations were also shuttered along with 19 health service providers and nine press organizations.
Meanwhile, detention orders were issued for 60 members of the air force, the agency reported.
The measures come under Turkey's ongoing state-of-emergency, which was put in place after a failed coup attempt by a faction in the military in July.
Civil servants are often named in the dismissal decrees, which are published publicly online in the Official Gazette, a controversial practice as the orders are made without a court.

The ministers said they would bolster their consular presence in various US cities and seek the support of local organizations and authorities to defend migrants' rights.
Guatemalan Foreign Minister Carlos Raul Morales said the actions are not intended to "push the panic button" -- as US immigration policies have not yet changed -- but rather "they are measures to be alert ."
The ministers also said they wanted to "have the best relationship" with Trump, who will take office January 20.
"Every one of us has the confidence, the commitment and the willingness to work to strengthen relations with the United States and guarantee the rights of our compatriots," said Salvadoran Foreign Minister Hugo Martinez.
According to official estimates, some six million migrants from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras live in the US -- the majority of them without legal residence -- while about 34 million Mexicans call the US home.

Trump's grandfather'kicked out of Germany for avoiding military service' (CNN) Donald Trump's grandfather was kicked out of his native Germany for failing to do his mandatory military service there, a historian has claimed.
A local council letter from 1905 informed Friedrich Trump -- who had become a United States citizen -- that he would not be granted his German citizenship back and that he had eight weeks to leave the country or be deported, German historian Roland Paul told CNN Tuesday.

For the very first time in the nation's history, Norway's bank notes will not be adorned with portraits.
Instead, the bills pay homage to Norway’s tight bonds with the sea.
The 100 kroner note displays Norway’s largest preserved Viking ship, the Gotskund, while the 200 kroner bill shows a large cod backed by herring and a fishing net.

"In the light of recent experience made with members of the previous commission, I feel that our code of conduct should be tightened in order to set the highest ethical standards possible for cases of conflict of interest," Juncker said in a statement.

Tighter rules are certainly not sufficient to bring about acceptable ethical behaviour in all cases, but they are an indispensable starting point ."

Germany amused by French candidate Fillon's Cold War map Berlin, Nov 23, 2016 (AFP) - German media reacted with amusement Wednesday after French presidential front-runner Francois Fillon published a map in a campaign brochure that showed a divided Germany, 26 years after reunification.

The 21-page paper, titled "Orientation in difficult times – for a successful Germany and Europe," is the party's reaction to the country's growing right-wing populist movement.
In the white paper, the CDU party leadership warns against competition from right-wing parties, saying they only promise "easy" answers, which do n't address the urgent problems facing Germany now and in the future.
Isolationism, protectionism and populism have never worked before, the paper says.
The authors refer reassuringly to Germany's social security systems. Merkel's party also says it is committed to improving domestic security, suggesting increased video surveillance and better equipping the police as options.
If need be, this should be prevented with "further measures ."
In addition, the party leadership suggests the immediate return of all shipwrecked migrants back to northern Africa where they could be housed in camps "in conjunction with the affected countries ."
The position paper thoroughly describes previous initiatives that have led to a drastic reduction in the number of refugees - the deal with Turkey, the classification of repressive countries as safe countries of origin, fences, and better border controls.
Immigrants should demonstrate their willingness to integrate by doing volunteer work, such as joining their communal volunteer firefighting brigade.
According to the CDU, this culture repudiates certain items of religious clothing, such as the full-body veil worn by some Muslim women.
But Islam remains under suspicion because, as the paper states, religion is not to be abused to spread hate, violence, terrorism, or repression.
Imams should be educated in Germany, and mosques suspected of radicalism are to be closely observed or closed if necessary.
The paper before the CDU presidium serves as a framework for the election platform on which the party will elaborate next spring.
NHL: New Las Vegas team unveils Golden Knights nickname New York, Nov 23, 2016 (AFP) - The National Hockey League's newest club was unveiled Tuesday as the Vegas Golden Knights by majority owner Bill Foley with colors and logo to match the nickname.
Five months after NHL owners sold Foley's group an expansion franchise for $500 million, the 31st NHL team began to take shape with a logo of a knight's helmet in front of a shield with a V-shaped front opening and colors of gold, back, red and steel grey.
The unveiling of the first major pro team in the US casino capital took place outside the new $375 million arena.
"We want our team to be known for dedication, honor, strength, courage and a commitment to never give up -- both on the ice and off," Foley said.
Vegas Golden Knights is that name. We selected'Knights' because knights are the defenders of the realm and protect those who can not defend themselves.
A secondary logo features swords that create the star from the iconic "Welcome to Las Vegas" sign.
These guys are going to win. '"The Golden Knights are the first NHL expansion team since the Columbus Blue Jackets and Minnesota Wild joined in 2000.

"This morning, the local planning and building committee made the decision to advance (plans)... for 500 units in Ramat Shlomo," the Ir Amim anti-settlement NGO said, referring to an ultra-Orthodox Jewish settlement neighbourhood.
The plans had been on hold since 2014, it said.
The municipality downplayed its decision, saying the plans were "not new and were approved years ago ."
"The political significance of this action is that it is the first plan to be promoted since the US elections," she said.
Meir Turjeman, chairman of the Jerusalem municipality planning committee, told public radio earlier in November that Trump's victory provided a green light to revive suspended permits in east Jerusalem.
The move was never recognised by the international community, which regards all Jewish settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories as illegal, including those in east Jerusalem.
Palestinians see east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state.
Wilders unapologetic as Dutch hate speech trial ends The Hague, Nov 23, 2016 (AFP) - Populist Dutch MP Geert Wilders remained unapologetic as his hate speech trial drew to a close on Wednesday, saying "millions of Dutch citizens will be convicted with me" if he is found guilty.
Wilders, 53, who had previously shunned hearings held at a high-security courthouse near Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, addressed a three-judge bench at the end of the three-week trial which will formally be closed on Friday.
"I am not a racist and my voters are neither.
They are people who want their country back and who are sick and tired of not being listened to," said Wilders, dressed in a dark blue suit and with his trademark peroxide hairdo.
"If you convict me, you will convict half of The Netherlands," said Wilders, who added: "Many Dutch will then lose the last bit of trust in the rule of law ."
Set for a verdict on December 9, the trial focuses in part on a comment made at a March 2014 local government election rally, when Wilders asked supporters whether they wanted "fewer or more Moroccans in your city and in the Netherlands".
When the crowd shouted back "Fewer!
Saeima endorses controversial teacher loyalty amendments to the Education Law RIGA, Nov 23 (LETA) - Saeima passed the so-called teacher loyalty amendments to the Education Law in the final reading today, establishing a set of rules for firing teachers who are found to be disloyal to the State of Latvia.
On the other hand, Education and Science Minister Karlis Sadurskis (Unity) responded that any sensible person could see that persons disloyal to the Constitution must not work as teachers.
However, Ilze Vinkele (Unity), head of Saeima Education, Culture and Science Committee, emphasized that the amendments were disrespectful to teachers as teachers had never been asked for their opinion.
Although the original version of the legislation has been improved, the amendments come "at a wrong time and place".
The legislation amends Section 51 of the Education Law, which deals with teachers' general obligations.
As a result, teachers can now be dismissed if they do not do their duty, including the duty to "raise virtuous, honest, and responsible patriots of Latvia, who will feel that they belong to the Republic of Latvia".
Section 30, Chapter 4 of the law will now include a new provision stating that the head of an educational institution must not only have impeccable reputation and be loyal to the Republic of Latvia and the Constitution, but that the prohibition of differential treatment will now also apply to school principals.
The amendments will come into force on January 1 next year.
1ST LEAD; Russia's Putin praises French presidential hopeful Fillon; By Peter Spinella, dpa Moscow (dpa) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday praised the winner of France's recent Republican presidential primary, Francois Fillon, as a very professional, well-mannered politician.
"Mr Fillon, in my view, significantly stands out from other politicians in the world because he initially appears to be such a reserved, non-public person," Putin said in comments carried by state news agency TASS.
"But with his very European manners, in the best sense of this term, he is able to maintain his point of view.
[He] does this very consistently.
In this sense, he is a tough negotiator.
He is, of course, a professional to a high extent," Putin said.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel would be "almost alone with Warsaw and the Baltics," said Pushkov, who heads the foreign affairs committee in Russia's lower house of parliament.

Reizniece-Ozola to have informal meeting with Latvians living in Britain RIGA, Nov 23 (LETA) - During an official visit to Great Britain later this month, Economics Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Greens/Farmers) will also have an informal meeting with Latvians residing in Britain to inform them about the latest developments in Latvia's financial sector, growth trends, and plans for the near future.
According to the Latvian Embassy in Great Britain, the minister will give a short speech and then engage in a conversation with representatives of Latvians living in Britain.
The meeting will take place at the Latvian Embassy in London on November 30.
Speaking in parliament for the first time since her announcement Sunday that she would seek re-election next year, Merkel cautioned that public opinion was being "manipulated" on the internet.
"Something has changed -- as globalisation has marched on, (political) debate is taking place in a completely new media environment.
Opinions are n't formed the way they were 25 years ago," she said.
"Today we have fake sites, bots, trolls -- things that regenerate themselves, reinforcing opinions with certain algorithms and we have to learn to deal with them ."
Merkel, 62, said the challenge for democrats was to "reach and inspire people -- we must confront this phenomenon and if necessary, regulate it ."
She said she supported initiatives by her right-left coalition government to crack down on "hate speech" on social media in the face of what she said were "concerns about the stability of our familiar order".
"Populism and political extremes are growing in Western democracies," she warned.
But media watchers say more is needed to stamp out a powerful phenomenon seen by some experts as a threat to democracy itself.
"There were 5,000 gold pieces, two bars of 12 kilos and 37 ingots of 1 kilo," Nicolas Fierfort, a local auctioneer, told AFP, confirming a report in the local La Depeche newspaper.
Fierfort, who had visited the house to value furniture offered for sale by the new owner, said the loot, which was worth 3.5 million euros ($3.7 million), was "extremely well hidden ."
"It was under the furniture, under piles of linen, in the bathroom... everywhere," he said, admitting that he himself had overlooked the gold on his visit.
First he found a tin box of coins screwed to the underside of a piece of furniture.
All the certificates of authenticity were later found in the deceased's estate.
The gold has already been sold to various French and international buyers.
Apart from being liable for a 45-percent inheritance tax, the finder will also have to pay three years in back taxes on it if the deceased failed to declare his treasures.

Turkey's Erdogan says EU Parliament vote has'no value' Istanbul, Nov 23, 2016 (AFP) - Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday that a European Parliament vote set to back a freeze of membership talks with Ankara over its relentless post-coup crackdown would have "no value".
"I want to say in advance from here and address the whole world watching on their TV screens -- this vote has no value at all, no matter what result emerges," Erdogan told a meeting of the Organisation of the Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Istanbul.
"It is not possible for me to even digest the message that they want to deliver," he said.
The European Parliament's main groups said Tuesday they will vote to freeze membership talks with Turkey because of the crackdown.
He said the vote was an indicator of the fact that the EU took the side of "terror organisations ."
DEVELOPING; Pro-government militias say Mosul cut off from rest of Iraq Baghdad (dpa) - Iraq's mainly Shiite pro-government militias say they have reached Kurdish Peshmerga positions west of Mosul, cutting off the Islamic State stronghold from the rest of Iraq and from Syria.
Peshmerga sources confirm that the Popular Mobilization militias have gained control of the road leading south-west from the Islamic State-held town of Tel Afar west of Mosul towards the Syrian border.
The militia advance means local Islamic State forces are surrounded in a pocket between the eastern outskirts of Mosul, where Iraqi troops are pushing into the city against fierce resistance, and the Tel Afar area.

Fillon, a 62-year-old social conservative with economically liberal ideas who admires late British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, unexpectedly topped the first round of the primaries last Sunday.
He would win the second round with 65 percent of votes versus 35 percent for Alain Juppe, another ex-prime minister who had for months been ahead in the opinion polls, the Ifop-Fiducial survey showed. Considering the divisions of the Left and deep unpopularity of Socialist President Francois Hollande, the winner of the run-off has a strong chance of being elected president in May.
Anyone can take part in the primaries, whether they are members of the Les Republicains conservative party or not.
Some 75 percent of sympathizers of Les Republicains will vote for Fillon, and 84 percent of those sympathizers of the far-right National Front party who intend to take part in the vote will also back Fillon, the poll showed.
Juppe is set to get 83 percent of the votes of left-wing voters and 66 percent of votes of centrist party sympathizers, the poll said.
Polls have for months predicted that National Front party leader Marine Le Pen would fare well in the first round of the presidential election on April 23 and qualify for the second round.
After Fillon's unexpected win and the surprise victories of President-elect Donald Trump in the United States and Britain's vote to leave the European Union, voters and commentators are increasingly skeptical about opinion poll predictions.
Denmark suspends quota refugee programme Copenhagen, Nov 22, 2016 (AFP) - The Danish government said on Tuesday that it had suspended a programme to receive around 500 refugees per year through the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) indefinitely.
"It will give the municipalities a little breathing space and room to better take care of those who have already come here," Integration Minister Inger Stojberg told a meeting in the Danish parliament.
The decision to suspend the programme indefinitely had been taken so that Denmark could cope "economically, socially and culturally," she said.
The centre-right minority government's move was backed by the anti-immigration Danish People's Party as well as the biggest opposition party, the Social Democrats.
Indonesia agrees to help solve mystery of missing shipwrecks Jakarta, Nov 23, 2016 (AFP) - Indonesia has agreed to work with the Netherlands to investigate the mysterious disappearance of several World War II shipwrecks -- considered war graves -- from the bottom of the Java Sea, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Wednesday.
Indonesia initially refused to take the blame for the missing ships, saying it had not been asked to protect the wrecks and therefore was not responsible for them.
But Jakarta has since agreed to cooperate with former colonial ruler The Netherlands in getting to the bottom of the mystery, Rutte said following a meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo.
Amateur divers discovered the long-lost wrecks of three Dutch warships in 2002, 60 years after they were sunk in the Battle of the Java Sea against Japanese forces.
But an international expedition that sailed to the wreck site ahead of next year's 75th anniversary of the battle was shocked to discover the wrecks and others had gone.
The early morning operation involving more than 160 officers was aimed at "a meeting point of the Salafist scene, in? which calls are made for jihad and hatred of our tolerant society is fomented," the interior minister of the state of Hesse, Peter Burth, said.
The aim was to send a signal to extremists that there was "no place for preachers of hate" in the state, Burth added.
The police raid was linked to an investigation into the Wahhabi association -? German officials use the equivalent term Salafist - the state Interior Ministry said.
"I think there are some problems to go to United States, so I will go to see the new president," he told reporters, without elaborating.

"Sometimes I feel during election the candidate has more freedom to express.
China regards the Dalai Lama as a separatist, though he says he merely seeks genuine autonomy for his Himalayan homeland Tibet, which Communist Chinese troops "peacefully liberated" in 1950.
Saeima rejects proposals for extending microenterprise tax regime RIGA, Nov 23 (LETA) - Saeima supported amendments to the Microenterprise Tax Law in the final reading today, turning down several proposals calling for extending the microenterprise tax regime.
Latvian Association of Regions, For Latvia from the Heart, and Saeima Economic, Agricultural, Environmental and Regional Policy Committee previously proposed that taxpayers could apply for the status of a microenterprise taxpayer also after June 30, 2017, contrary to what the law currently says.

Prominent Turkish novelist Asli Erdogan to stay in jail Istanbul, Nov 23, 2016 (AFP) - Prominent Turkish novelist Asli Erdogan and linguist Necmiye Alpay are to remain in jail on charges of terror group membership despite an earlier report on Wednesday that they were to be released.
Erdogan and Alpay have been held 97 and 85 days respectively in a women's prison in Istanbul over their involvement in a pro-Kurdish newspaper in a case that has caused international alarm.
An Istanbul court ordered the release of the pair on charges of seeking to disrupt state unity, Asli Erdogan's lawyer Erdal Dogan told AFP outside Bakirkoy women's prison on the outskirts of Istanbul.
But it also ordered they remain in pre-trial detention on separate charges of membership of a banned terror organisation and thus "their arrest continues", he added.
The initial release order prompted reports on Turkish media that they were being set free but state news agency Anadolu also confirmed they were to stay in jail.
KVV Liepajas Metalurgs sale strategy sent to creditors for harmonization RIGA, Nov 23 (LETA) - Guntars Koris, administrator for the insolvent joint-stock metallurgical company KVV Liepajas Metalurgs, has completed work on a sales strategy for the company and sent it to be harmonized by the company's creditors, as Koris' representative Dzintars Hmielevskis told LETA.
"According to the Insolvency Law, the deadline for selling the property is six months from the day the insolvency process commenced, or March 16, 2017.
Of course, the administrator may request for the deadline to be postponed," said Hmielevskis.
According to the strategy, the administrator wishes to sell KVV Liepajs Metalurgs property as a whole, as only in this case will it be possible operations of the steel plant, added Hmielevskis.
The appraisers are to set the precise value of the property by January 2017, but it is possible that this could happen sooner," said Hmielevskis.
The total amount of secured creditor claims is EUR 86.935 million, and the claims by unsecured creditors add up to EUR 29.652 million.
The government also authorized the Latvian Privatization Agency (LPA) to establish a company, FeLM, to which the State Treasury will assign its claim against KVV Liepajas Metalurgs.
The steel plant owes EUR 65 million to the Latvian state.
KVV Group said it was preparing to sue Latvia in the European Commission's Anti-Monopoly and Corruption Prevention Committee, which could lead to Latvia being hit with a penalty of between EUR 150 to 300 million.

Diaspora Council urges politicians to build network of contacts of Latvians living abroad RIGA, Nov 23 (LETA) - Instead of focusing on measures encouraging emigrants to return to Latvia, politicians of Latvia should proactively build a network of contacts of Latvians living abroad, and use it to foster the economic development of Latvia, as members of the Consultative Council of Diaspora Businessmen told LETA.
Commenting on the position of the Foreign Investors Council in Latvia (FICIL), that Latvia should develop a smart immigration policy in order to solve the labor force problems, the council suggests that Latvians residing abroad could contribute substantially to the economic development of Latvia.
For instance, they can invest their time, ideas, even money, said Andris Berzins, one of the founders of TechHub Riga.
According to the council, several returnees - investors and company heads who were invited to become members of the council last year - believe that Latvia can use to its advantage the fact that "Latvians are everywhere, and often in high positions".
Building a network of compatriots' contacts once helped the Irish economy grow into the "Celtic Tiger", said investment fund NCH Capital Inc Vice-President Karlis Cerbulis.
Far-right extremist jailed for life for killing British MP Jo Cox London, Nov 23, 2016 (AFP) - A far-right extremist was Wednesday sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of release for murdering British MP Jo Cox a week before the European Union referendum in a "politically motivated" attack.
"Because she was a member of parliament your crime has an additional dimension that calls for particular punishment," judge Alan Wilkie told Thomas Mair, 53, as he issued the rare "whole life term" punishment.
"There is no doubt it was done to further a political motive ."
Mair showed no emotion as the sentence was read out.
Following the verdict, Cox's husband Brendan called the murder "a political act and an act of terrorism ." "We have no interest in the perpetrator, we only feel pity for him," he added.
Investigators found an extensive collection of books on German military history, the Holocaust and Nazi race theory and a statue of a bust of the eagle of Germany's Third Reich when they searched Mair's Birstall home.
A 77-year-old local man, Bernard Carter-Kenny, was stabbed as he attempted to stop the attack.
Five member states want EU-wide laws on encryption euractiv Five EU countries said they want the European Commission to propose legislation that would make it easier for police to crack through encryption technology.
Croatia, Italy, Latvia, Poland and Hungary all want an EU law to be created to help their law enforcement authorities access encrypted information and share data with investigators in other countries.

But in a statement obtained by dpa, the US? domestic intelligence agency said it would pursue no further investigation and that "no charges have been filed" in the matter.

An investigation by the Department of Children and Family Services in Los Angeles was also closed on November 10, after the actors agreed to certain safeguards, Jolie's PR? team said.
DW According to a German media report, the social democratic SPD party is granting access to ministers and officials in exchange for payments of up to 7,000 euros. Experts say this may violate the law on political parties.
The SPD-affiliated agency Network Media GmbH (NWMD) is accused of pocketing between 3,000 and 7,000 euros ($3,186 - $7,435) from companies and lobby groups, the ZDF program "Frontal 21" reported on Tuesday.
Politicians who benefited from the sponsored talks are said to include the likes of Minister for Justice Heiko Maas, Minister for Labor and Social Affairs Andrea Nahles, Minister for the Environment Barbara Hendricks, Minister for Family Affairs Manuela Schwesig, Parliamentary Group Leader Thomas Oppermann and General Secretary Katarina Barley.
NWMD confirmed that such talks took place. However, it said its mission was to find partners who would incur the costs of hosting such events.
The agency has since accused "Frontal 21" of "bypassing the truth" in its report, maintaining that it did not profit from the meetings.
"This kind of sponsorship is clever, but is nevertheless an unlawful circumvention of party funding rules," the Konstanz-based administrative lawyer Sophie Schönberger said.
"Politics must not be bought or even appear to be for sale," campaigner Christina Deckwirth said.
She accused the SPD of providing "exclusive access to politics to lobbyists able to afford it ."
Leading member of Germany's Left Party, Klaus Ernst, said: "When it comes to whose voice is heard among SPD officials, it's obviously a question of who has the deepest pockets ."
Ernst also voiced his suspicion that SPD legislation, for example concerning temporary work and tenancy law, had been influenced during these exclusive meetings.
However, the SPD refused to disclose who contributed how much "due to contractual reasons ."

EU parliament president Schulz to return to Berlin politics Berlin/Brussels (dpa) - The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, said Wednesday he would leave the role and return to his native Germany to enter federal politics, according to local media.
Schulz, who is a member of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD), made the comments to German broadcaster ARD and said he would provide exact details in Brussels on Thursday.
Schulz is regarded as a possible alternative SPD candidate for the chancellorship to Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel, who serves as Angela Merkel's deputy in the coalition government.
The SPD will announce its candidate for the chancellorship in January despite pressure to respond to Angela Merkel's recent announcement that she will run for a fourth term in office.
"At least seven buses with pilgrims were inside the petrol station at the time," a police lieutenant colonel told AFP.
The blast struck in the village of Shomali, 120 kilometres (75 miles) southeast of the capital Baghdad and around 80 kilometres (50 miles) from Karbala.

US Green Party candidate seeks recount amid questions about Trump win Washington (dpa) - Jill Stein, the US Green Party's presidential candidate, called Wednesday for a recount in three US? states amid concerns about the election of Donald Trump.
"After a divisive and painful presidential race, in which foreign agents hacked into party databases, private email servers, and voter databases in certain states, many Americans are wondering if our election results are reliable," Stein said.
"That's why the unexpected results of the election and reported anomalies need to be investigated before the 2016 presidential election is certified.
New York Magazine had reported earlier that a group of computer scientists and election lawyers was calling for recounts in three of the states won by Trump pointing to concerns about manipulation and hacking.
The activists had reportedly last week briefed Hillary Clinton's staff that the Democrat received fewer votes in counties with electronic voting machines than in ones where paper ballots were used.
Xinjiang residents must turn in passports: media Beijing, Nov 24, 2016 (AFP) - All residents in China's restive region of Xinjiang must hand in their passports to local police stations for "examination and management", the Global Times newspaper said Thursday.
"Anyone who needs the passport must apply to the police station," an anonymous police officer in Aksu prefecture told the paper, adding that the policy had been implemented throughout Xinjiang.
Many members of the more than 10 million-strong Muslim Uighur minority in the region complain of discrimination -- including denials of passport applications -- as well as controls on their culture and religion.
In June, local state-run media reported that the mostly Kazakh residents of a Xinjiang border district had to give police DNA samples, fingerprints, voiceprints and a "three-dimensional image" in order to apply for certain travel documents, including passports.
"The government, in an irresponsible manner, froze the dialogue process by not showing up to two technical meetings last night," opposition coalition leader Jesus Torrealba told Reuters.
Opposition activists said authorities backed away after the National Assembly on Tuesday held a heated session in which they slammed Maduro over a drug scandal.
"The government is using the debate as an excuse," said two-time presidential candidate Henrique Capriles, accusing authorities of not being committed to talks.
"The government has not complied with any of its promises.
They promised to free political prisoners; there are more than 100 imprisoned.
Maduro acknowledged "difficulties" in the talks but said they were still on track.
"The dialogue is advancing... and by January, February or March, it will be strengthened," he told reporters.
It was not clear if the opposition would resume a more militant agenda, which before the talks included protests and putting Maduro on trial before the National Assembly.
The signature drive began in February of this year, however the last approximately 100 signatures were collected yesterday and last night, when Saeima was debating next year's budget.
The initiative posted on Manabalss.lv emphasized that members of parliament are elected to make decisions, not to avoid them, however, the current Rules of Procedure allow members to not only vote "for" or "against", but also to abstain from voting.
It is MPs' job to represent the nation in the decision-making process - create laws, appoint high officials and decide upon other important questions.
"Someone could object that there are votes where it would be unethical for a Saeima member to participate in. For example, if the vote concerns their personal interests.
However, already now such MPs can simply not participate in voting and the current option to abstain does not solve the problem.
On the contrary, it misleads the voters, because to abstain from voting is the same as voting against," it was explained in the initiative.
It emphasized that the current practice shows that some Saeima members abstain even in nationally-crucial votes.
In many other parliaments, including in countries with democratic traditions centuries long, parliament members do not have the option to abstain from voting.
Consequently, it suggested that last sentence in Article 139 of the Rules of Procedure of Saeima, "The Members who have voted "for" or "against" or "abstained" shall be regarded as having participated in the vote" - the words "or against" be crossed out.
A cooling tower platform plunged to the ground in the early hours, trapping an unknown number of people beneath it, Xinhua said.
Pictures of the scene in Fengcheng, in the central province of Jiangxi, showed a grey mass of concrete slabs, steel girders and twisted metal splayed in a heap on the ground inside a large round structure.
Rescue work was underway, and a total of 32 firetrucks and 212 military personnel had been deployed to the scene, the Jiangxi provincial fire department said on a verified social media account.

Around 68 people were on site when the collapse occurred, according to local state media outlet China Jiangxi Online.
"The tens of thousands of Poles living here in Ireland deserve to have their children, if they wish it, also educated in the Polish language; I will strive for that," said Waszczykowski during a meeting on Wednesday with the Polish community in Dublin.
He also announced that Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny will visit Poland in February.
During his meeting with the Polish community, Waszczykowski also said he hoped that more Polish expatriates will return to their home country, stressing that the government is making efforts to attract them back.
"That is not to say, however, that we would accept it if you were expelled from the UK," he said, referring to concerns about growing xenophobic sentiments after the Brexit referendum.
Four dead in gunbattle in Russia's turbulent Ingushetia region Moscow (dpa) - Two Russian special forces officers and two suspected militants were killed in a gunbattle in a residential neighbourhood in southern Russia's turbulent Ingushetia region, authorities said Thursday.

Merkel's Bavarian ally demands refugee limit as elections loom Berlin (dpa) - The leader of Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU) has made continuing support for Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) dependent on the creation of an annual limit of 200,000 refugees entering Germany.

Seehofer's intervention came after Merkel announced on Sunday that she would lead the CDU into elections next year, seeking a fourth term as chancellor.

They allege that Eto'o -- now at Antalyaspor in Turkey -- set up front companies to avoid paying taxes from 2006 to 2009, when he was a striker at Barcelona before leaving for Inter Milan. The fraud, they say, amounts to some 3.9 million euros.
"The footballer pretended he had ceded his rights to two other companies in Hungary and Spain so as to fraudulently avoid paying taxes," they added in accusations seen by AFP calling for Eto'o to be tried.
Prosecutors estimate the footballer, a four-time former African Player of the Year, should reimburse the alleged fraud to tax authorities plus interest, and pay a 14.3-million-euro fine.
They want a prison sentence of 18 months for the 2006 fraud, and then three years jail for each subsequent year until 2009.

European Parliament backs freeze of Turkish membership talks Strasbourg, France, Nov 24, 2016 (AFP) - The European Parliament on Thursday voted in favour of halting membership talks with Turkey over its post-coup crackdown, in a vote that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had already branded worthless.
The non-binding motion approved by MEPs said parliament "calls... on the Commission and on the Member States to initiate a temporary freeze of the on-going accession negotiations with Turkey ."
The assembly in Strasbourg, France, said however that it "remains committed to keep Turkey anchored to the EU ."
While the vote will have no concrete effect as EU member states with the exception of Austria so far want to keep the talks on track, it is yet another blow to relations that seemed to be accelerating just months ago.
Three Turkish soldiers killed in IS Syria Syria: report Istanbul, Nov 24, 2016 (AFP) - Three Turkish soldiers were killed and seven wounded in an attack by Islamic State (IS) jihadists in northern Syria, Dogan news agency reported Thursday.
The attack, carried out by "members of the Daesh (IS) terror group," took place in the Al Bab region of northern Syria where Turkish forces are supporting an offensive by pro-Ankara rebels, the privately-run news agency said.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan this week said the rebels were pushing forward with the aim of taking Al Bab from the jihadists.
"We reached Al Bab right now and besieged it from the west," the president said in a speech Tuesday.
The decision is the first time an administrative court has confirmed the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) practice of granting so-called "subsidiary protection" to asylum seekers who primarily come from Syria.
"There is no evidence" to support claims that the Syrian government suspects those who have fled the country of belonging to the opposition, presiding Judge Uta Strzyz said.
Since the German Foreign Office has not been represented in Syria since 2012, questions about the woman's safety upon return to Syrian "could not be answered at all," argued the woman's lawyer Kristin Hanke.
Instead, the woman would have to prove that she personally faces persecution should she return.
Fleeing the country due to the war did not suffice as a reason for asylum, according to the court and the BAMF lawyer.
Bernd Mesovic, the deputy director of the human rights organization "Pro Asyl," sharply criticized the ruling, saying: "The refugee agency UNHCR has pointed out patterns of Syrians being arrested and disappearing upon their return ."
In Germany, around 113,000 refugees - including 94,000 Syrians - have only been granted the second-tier status.
Full asylum protection under the Geneva Convention typically includes permission to remain in the asylum country for three years, which is usually followed by an unlimited residence permit. Refugees also have the right to family reunification.
A "subsidiary protection," on the other hand, only grants a residency permit for one year which could possible be extended for another two years.
For the Syrian woman in the Schleswig case, this means her husband and four children who are currently living in Turkey will not be able to join her in Germany until 2018.
She may appeal the ruling which would take the case to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
Migrants riot in largest Bulgaria refugee camp: police Sofia, Bulgaria, Nov 24, 2016 (AFP) - About 1,500 migrants started a riot in Bulgaria's largest refugee camp on Thursday amid growing tensions in displaced persons reception centres across the Balkans, officials said.
The migrants set car tyres on fire and threw stones at some 250 police, firefighters and gendarmerie at the Harmanli reception centre close to the Turkish border, local police spokeswoman Nina Nikolova told AFP.
The centre, which houses well over 3,000 migrants, was the scene of another protest in October when several hundred Afghans demanded they be allowed to continue their journey towards western Europe.

PM: Estonia's foreign policy will be more active TALLINN, Nov 24, BNS - Estonia's foreign and security policy will not see a change in ideological direction, but its intensity will increase, Prime Minister Juri Ratas said on Thursday.
"I affirmed that Estonia's foreign policy will change in a sense that we want to contribute more, but it wo n't change ideologically," Ratas said at Thursday's government press conference when talking about his telephone conversation with his Finnish colleague.
The new government in its coalition agreement promises to increase the resources of Estonia's foreign service.
"I confirm as defense minister and chairman of the Pro Patria and Res Publica Union (IRL) that Estonia's defense and security policy as well as foreign policy will not change.
Our task is to actively communicate with partners.
"Our message to the allies is that they can rest easy as we will contribute even more than before," Tsahkna said.
The survey shows that employees in fields such as science and education, security and rescue services, and state and municipal institutions mostly have fixed working hours.
The option to work remotely is becoming increasingly popular.
Clarifying how many hours on average full time employees spend at work, excluding breaks and non-work related activities, the survey concludes that 46 percent of respondents work seven to eight hours, every fourth person or 25 percent less than seven hours, and 29 percent work more than eight hours a day on the average.
CV-Online Latvia representative Krista Rozina notes that when assessing the results, it should be taken into account that working hours do not denote work efficiency and the number of work hours should not be a priority.
"It is more important to achieve that working hours are not only the hours spent at work, but effective and target-oriented, properly planned out work, denoting each job's priorities, available resources and deadlines.
It also has to be acknowledged that properly planned work is just as important as having breaks in between intensive jobs, allowing employees to catch their breath, rest their minds and prepare for the next task", indicated Rozina.
The survey took place this year from October 24 to November 6.
Overall 1,398 respondents were interviewed from different industries.

US Green Party raises enough funds for Wisconsin recount Washington, Nov 24, 2016 (AFP) - The former Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein has raised the necessary $1.1 million to request a vote recount in Wisconsin, her campaign announced Thursday.
"Congratulations on meeting the recount costs for Wisconsin," Stein's website read.
"Raising money to pay for the first round so quickly is a miraculous feat and a tribute to the power of grassroots organizing ."

"The unexpected results of the election and reported anomalies need to be investigated before the 2016 presidential election is certified," Stein said on her website.
"We deserve elections we can trust ."
Wisconsin swung Republican for the time since voters there helped elect Ronald Reagan in 1984.
A letter that Latvijas Propana Gaze board member Aleksandrs Sinegubovs submitted to the Riga City Council has been posted on Riga Mayor Nils Usakovs' (Harmony) Twitter account, which says that the company is planning to lay off about 185 sales representatives.
This is due to amendments to the law on State Social Insurance approved by Saeima, which stipulate that, from January 1 next year, companies will have to make social contributions for all employees who are paid less than the minimum wage.
They are paid EUR 1 to EUR 100 a month, depending on the number of gas cylinders they sell that month.
To 60 percent of the company's sales representatives, this is opportunity to make a little money on the side, therefore the overall number of unemployed will not necessarily increase.
The company employs 497 people on the average.
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Dana Reizniece- Ozola (Greens/Farmers) said that Saeima social and labor affairs committee is already working to expand the groups of people the changes will not apply to, for example, pensioners, disabled people.

“With Briedis, although there’s probably not a lot of money in it, the fight is a mandatory.
Let’s be honest, there wasn’t much money in the BJ Flores fight but I just wanted to shut him up.
Vallily was also one of my main sparring partners for that last fight and he’s a good fighter but ultimately he’s not me.
“I bang with both hands.
I can end a fight in the first second or the last second and Briedis is yet to fight anybody who can do that.
“His best win is probably at heavyweight against Manuel Charr but these fellas are not on the same level as me.

Terror gang was set to hit Paris on Dec 1: source Paris, Nov 24, 2016 (AFP) - A jihadist terror ring was planning to attack Paris on December 1 and had researched sites including a Christmas market and Disneyland outside the capital as potential targets, a police source said Thursday.
Seven suspects were arrested in police raids last weekend in the eastern city of Strasbourg and Marseille in the south following an eight-month investigation by security services, although two were later released.
The source said investigators found the suspects had made internet searches on sites including the Christmas market on the prestigious Champs-Elysees avenue, the Disneyland Paris theme park, cafe terraces in the northeast of the capital, the Paris criminal police headquarters and a metro station.
One of the men is said to have told investigators that attacks were planned and named the police headquarters in central Paris and the DGSI domestic security department in the northwest of the city as targets.
Some members of the group are thought to have taken orders from a Syria-based jihadist.
Report: no F1 race in Germany in 2017 Abu Dhabi (dpa) - The German Formula One Grand Prix has been scrapped from the official 2017 calendar which is to be ratified next week, the Auto, Motor und Sport (AMS) magazine said on its website Thursday.
AMS said that according to information from the teams the German race is no longer on the calendar after being included in the provisional list with a July 30 date and Hockenheimring as venue.
Organizers in Hockenheim and at the Nuerburgring have struggled financially over the past years, and there was also no race in the country in 2014.
Without Hockenheim, the 2017 calendar consists of 20 races from the March 26 opener in Australia to the November 26 finale in Abu Dhabi.
The calendar is to be formally approved by the ruling body FIA on November 30.
Ancient city uncovered in Egypt Cairo, Nov 23, 2016 (AFP) - Archaeologists have uncovered an ancient Egyptian city and graveyard dating back to around 5300 BC, the antiquities ministry said on Wednesday.
The city and cemetery -- likely home to senior functionaries and grave builders -- was discovered about 400 metres (1300 feet) from the Temple of Seti I in the ancient city of Abydos in southern Egypt, said antiquities minister Mahmoud Afifi.
They also discovered 15 large graves -- some of them even larger than royal graves in Abydos -- suggesting they housed the bodies of important figures.
"This discovery can shed light on a lot of information on the history of Abydos," a ministry statement quoted Afifi as saying.
The city of Abydos, founded by predynastic rulers, is famed for its temples such as that of Seti I and its graves.
Grigule, Mamikins and Zdanoka were the only MEPs from Latvia to vote against the resolution, in which the EP suggests reinforcing the European Union's strategic communication task force and investing more in awareness raising, education, online and local media, investigative journalism and information literacy.
MEPs Inese Vaidere (Unity) and Roberts Zile (National Alliance) did not participate in the vote.
The resolution stresses that the EU needs to counter disinformation campaigns and propaganda from countries, such as Russia, and non-state actors, like Daesh, Al-Qaeda and other violent jihadi terrorist groups.
Hostile propaganda against the EU and its member states seeks to distort the truth, provoke doubt, divide the EU and its North American partners, paralyze the decision-making process, discredit the EU institutions and incite fear and uncertainty among EU citizens, says the text.
1ST LEAD; EU Parliament president Schulz confirms return to German politics; By Marc Kalpidis and Verena Schmitt-Roschmann, dpa Berlin/Brussels (dpa) - The president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, on Thursday confirmed he would leave Brussels to seek election to the German parliament as a member for the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in the elections set for the autumn of next year.
"Next year, I will run for the German Bundestag as the head of the SPD list in North Rhine-Westphalia," Schulz, 60, said in a statement issued in Brussels.
"My commitment to the European project is unwavering.
From now on I will be fighting for this project from the national level, but my values do not change," the dedicated European said.
Schulz, who speaks six European languages, is seen as a candidate for the position of foreign minister, which is likely to become vacant in February if incumbent Frank-Walter Steinmeier assumes the ceremonial role of German president as expected.
But there is also speculation in Germany that the SPD could choose the outspoken Schulz to lead the party into the Bundestag elections in place of party leader Sigmar Gabriel, who has yet to signal his intentions. For the Christian Democrats (CDU), Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday formally announced she would seek a fourth term as chancellor.

1ST LEAD; EU? Parliament votes to freeze Turkey membership talks; By Monica Raymunt, dpa Brussels (dpa) - The European Parliament voted overwhelmingly in favour of freezing the EU's membership negotiations with Turkey.
The non-binding vote has no legal impact on the talks, but it sends a strong political signal to Ankara and puts pressure on the European Commission, which is leading the negotiations.
"Turkey is an important partner of the EU," lawmakers said in an emailed statement.
"But in partnerships, the will to cooperate has to be two-sided ."
"Turkey is not showing this political will as the government's actions are further diverting Turkey from its European path," the lawmakers added.
According to a draft of the resolution outlined by members of six parliamentary factions, lawmakers pledged to review their position when "the disproportionate measures under the state of emergency in Turkey are lifted" and then evaluate "whether the rule of law and human rights are restored throughout the country ."
The imprisonment of 10 journalists and employees at opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet and the arrest of 10 opposition lawmakers from the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party added to worries about the rule of law and freedom of expression in Turkey.

Swiss to vote on faster nuclear phaseout Geneva, Nov 25, 2016 (AFP) - Swiss voters will head to the polls on Sunday to decide whether or not to speed up the process of phasing out the country's nuclear power plants.
Switzerland has already vowed to do so but a "yes" vote would force three of its five reactors to close next year.
Just a few months after Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant was wrecked in the March 2011 tsunami disaster, Switzerland decided to gradually close its nuclear plants, but without setting a clear timeline.
But all of Switzerland's nuclear plants have open-ended operating licences, meaning they can continue operating as long as they are deemed safe.
That was not good enough for Switzerland's Green Party, which five years ago launched the initiative that comprises Sunday's vote, calling for the reactors to run no longer than 45 years.
A "yes" vote would entail the final closure next year of Beznau, which has been operating in the northern Swiss canton of Aargau, near the German border for 47 years.
"The reduction in electricity output could not be compensated quickly enough by electricity generated from renewable sources," it warned in its policy position.
"This would mean that Switzerland would have to import a large amount of electricity in the coming years," it said, warning that "this would undermine the security of supply and would not make ecological sense, because foreign electricity is often produced by coal-fired power stations ."
The Greens also appear to have the backing of the people, but polls show that support has dwindled in recent weeks.
Snowden loses final Norway appeal for no-extradition pledge Oslo, Nov 25, 2016 (AFP) - Norway's supreme court on Friday rejected a final appeal by fugitive whistleblower Edward Snowden to secure assurances he would not be extradicted to the US should he travel to Norway to collect an award.
Just as was the case in an original lawsuit and the subsequent appeal to a lower court in Oslo, the supreme court said it could not evaluate an extradition request preemptively.
It's a further blow for the 33-year-old US citizen and his supporters at the Norwegian branch of the PEN Club who hoped he would be able to pick up the Ossietzky prize, which celebrates "outstanding efforts for freedom of expression ."
Snowden has also been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, which is also awarded in Norway, for the last three years, although without winning it.
Poll: Majority of German welcome Merkel's plan to run again Berlin (dpa) - Almost two-thirds of Germans welcome the fact that German Chancellor Angela Merkel will put herself forward as chancellor in elections expected next year, according to a poll published on Friday.

The precise date for the election has yet to be set.
British ex-PMs raise possibility of new Brexit vote London, Nov 25, 2016 (AFP) - Former British prime minister John Major believes there is a "credible case" for a second referendum on Brexit, a newspaper reported Friday, after his successor Tony Blair suggested the process could be stopped.
Major, a former leader of Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative party, warned against the "tyranny of the majority" in implementing the June vote to leave the European Union, in which 52 percent opted for Brexit.
"I hear the argument that the 48 percent of people who voted to stay should have no say in what happens.
"The tyranny of the majority has never applied in a democracy and it should not apply in this particular democracy ."
"I do n't know whether that will happen.
He said he accepted Britain would not remain a full member of the EU but still hoped for a deal that would enable the country to stay as close as possible to the union and its single market.
"It can be stopped if the British people decide that, having seen what it means, the pain-gain cost-benefit analysis does n't stack up," Blair told the New Statesman magazine.
He added: "I'm not saying it will (be stopped), by the way, but it could.
I'm just saying: until you see what it means, how do you know ?"

For a long time, we have been trying to show that problems in the industry concern interests of broader society, not just the respective market players," continued Meisitis.
"There are many electronic communication operators and media in Latvia, but unfortunately we can not say for sure that they all play by the rules - pay taxes and fees, license payments, obey the law.
"We can not say with full certainty that the regulators, supervisory and law enforcement authorities are doing everything they can and what is in their competence to keep illegal business practices from spreading in the industry," added the expert.
Despite that, Meisitis expressed satisfaction that certain progress could be seen in the fight against illegal distribution of audiovisual content.

Some 11,500 teachers suspected of links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) -- which has waged an insurgency since 1984 -- were suspended in September alone.

Tens of thousands of jobs to be cut next year due to new social contribution rules - Endzins RIGA, Nov 25 (LETA) - Applying the minimum social contribution to all wages, including wages paid to part-time employees, could result in liquidation of tens of thousands of jobs next year, Latvian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Chairman of the Board Janis Endzins told LETA.
Amendments to the Law on State Social Insurance that Saeima supported on Wednesday stipulate that employers will have to make social contributions also for every employee who is paid less than the minimum wage from January 1 next year.
"We expect that tens of thousands of workers will be laid off or they will be paid their wages under the table," said Endzins, adding that he was confident this would result in a substantial reduction in the number of jobs in Latvia.

To 60 percent of the company's sales representatives, this is opportunity to make a little money on the side, therefore the overall number of unemployed will not necessarily increase.
Estonia gets bigger fish quotas in border lakes for next year TALLINN, Nov 25, BNS – Estonian fishers will be allowed to harvest 3,507 tons of fish in the interconnected lakes of Peipsi, Lammijarv and Lake Pskov on the country's border with Russia in 2017, about 17 percent more than this year, according to harvest caps agreed by Estonian and Russian officials.
"In deciding about the harvest caps recommendations of scientists were taken into account.
Scientists estimated the situation of the pike perch, perch, bream and pike stocks to be good, whereas the restriction on catches of smelt and houting has to be left in force to protect the stocks," said the head of the Estonian delegation, secretary general of the Ministry of Environment Andres Talijarv.
Stocks of smelt and houting remain low partly because of high numbers of prey fish in the lakes and also as a result of weather having been not favorable to spawning.
The overall fishing quota for the three lakes in 2017 is 7,014 tons, which is divided equally between Estonia and Russia.
Iraq forces must open safe routes for Mosul residents: NGO Arbil, Iraq, Nov 25, 2016 (AFP) - Iraqi forces should create safe exits for Mosul residents because they can not protect civilians and wage fierce battles with jihadists at the same time, an aid group said on Friday.
Around 70,000 people have fled their homes in the region since the start on October 17 of a huge offensive against Mosul, only about 30,000 of them from inside the city itself.
The number of displaced is significantly lower than what the United Nations and other aid organisations had forecast before the operation began.
"Which is why Iraqi forces need to do everything they can to ensure there are safe routes of escape," Milutinovic said.
"The fighting in Mosul also makes it very difficult to deliver aid and with supplies already running low there are also fears that families will soon be without any food or medicine," he said.

“These days the full force of the law often means we collect personal details from offenders and the judges let them go free, ” said Wendt.

The woman suffered life-threatening injuries and is currently in an induced coma in a hospital in Hanover.
Wendt told the PNP that the 38-year-old man was a known offender with a long criminal record to his name, adding that only two days before the crime, the victim had reported him to police.

Therefore, we back faster introduction of a visa-free regime for Ukraine," he told BNS.
We fought to the end and we were rewarded with this point, in this crazy group where everyone is almost tied.
And you could even have won at the very end of the game...
It would have been fantastic, but we're going to be honest: a 2-1 victory on our part would have been "too much," if I may say so.
We gave everything in the last few minutes, throwing ourselves at the attack.
We finished with six offensive players, so we can not be accused of shyness.
But yes, Villarreal was better than us in the first half, even if we had our chances.
Without a great Andris Vanins, we would have been led 0-2. And it was over.
So yes, Andris kept us in the game and we have to thank him.
You know, I said before this game that today it was a final.

Football: Mourinho off in Man Utd draw, Sanchez fires Arsenal London, Nov 27, 2016 (AFP) - Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho was sent off as his side lost more ground in the Premier League title race by drawing 1-1 with West Ham United on Sunday.
After Diafra Sakho's second-minute opener was cancelled out by Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Mourinho was sent to the stands for kicking a water bottle in protest at Paul Pogba's booking for diving.
Mourinho reacted by furiously kicking a water bottle and was duly sent to the stands for the second time this season.

- Debuchy blow - Arsenal ended a run of three straight draws in all competitions with victory over Bournemouth at the Emirates Stadium.
Bournemouth equalised in the 23rd minute when Callum Wilson netted from the penalty spot after Nacho Monreal was adjudged to have fouled him.
It was a harsh call, but Monreal made amends in the 53rd minute, masterfully steering Mesut Ozil's cross back across goal for Theo Walcott to restore Arsenal's lead with a rare header.
Right-back Mathieu Debuchy, making his first Arsenal start for 370 days, was forced off by a hamstring injury in the first half and Wenger expressed fear the problem was "severe".
The outbreak was detected at a farm in Biddinghuizen, about 70 kilometres (43 miles) west of Amsterdam, where about 180,000 ducks were put down together with another 10,000 within a one kilometre radius, the Dutch food and safety watchdog NVWA said.
Earlier this month the Netherlands shuttered petting zoos and banned duck hunting as it stepped up measures to stem a bird flu outbreak blamed for killing scores of poultry and more than a thousand wild birds in the country. In the western port of Rotterdam, a park closed its animal section after several aquatic birds were found to have died from the H5N8 virus.
Avian flu severely hit the Netherlands in 2003 with health authorities destroying some 30 million birds in an effort to quash an outbreak.

"You have to bang your fist on the table to get reforms through in this country. We have to stop giving into the power of the street," he said.
Formula One: Rosberg foils Hamilton to claim maiden title Abu Dhabi, Nov 27, 2016 (AFP) - Nico Rosberg clinched his maiden world title on Sunday when he finished second in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix despite Lewis Hamilton ignoring team orders in his quest to foil the German.
Hamilton reeled off his 10th win of the season - the most by any driver not to win the title - and the 53rd of his career, but his gamesmanship upset his team and his team-mate in the closing laps.
"Yippppeee !" Rosberg replied.
Rosberg joined an exclusive club by becoming only the second son of a former champion to take the title, his father Keke having won the championship 34 years ago with the Williams team.
Briton Damon Hill did the same when he won the title with Williams, following his father Graham's achievements, in 1996.
"I'm very proud to have done the same feat as my Dad achieved ."
"Vettel is a threat ."
"You should just let us race," he replied.

"I'm very happy to play for Bayern for another year," Ribery said.

The 29-year-old was forced off just after the half-hour and replaced by Daniele Rugani as the five-time consecutive Italian champions were rocked at the Luigi Ferraris stadium.
Juve conceded a third goal just before the half-hour when Brazilian wing-back Alex Sandro booted Luca Rigoni's effort into the roof of the net as he tried in vain to clear off the goalline.
On Saturday, AC Milan secured a 4-1 win over Empoli to reinforce second spot and sit just four points off the lead.

Swiss reject faster nuclear phaseout: results Geneva, Nov 27, 2016 (AFP) - Switzerland's ageing nuclear reactors will keep running for the foreseeable future, after voters Sunday rejected a call to speed up the phaseout of the plants.
A full 54.2 percent of voters and an overwhelming majority of Switzerland's 26 cantons voted against an initiative which would have forced three of the country's five nuclear reactors to close next year, according to final results.
Just a few months after Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant was destroyed in the March 2011 tsunami disaster, Switzerland decided to gradually close its nuclear plants, but did not set a clear timeline.
The government's plan is to decommission five ageing reactors, which today produce around a third of the country's electricity, as they reach the end of their safe operational lifespan.
The Muhlberg plant, which opened in Bern canton in 1972, would also have needed to close next year if the Greens had gotten their way, while Gosgen in Solothurn would have shut in 2024 and, finally, Leibstadt in Aargau by 2029. The Swiss government supports gradually shutting down the plants, but it forcefully opposed the initiative, insisting that Switzerland's reactors are safe and cautioning that premature closures could "undermine the security of supply".

Brazilian prospect Boschilia opened the scoring midway through the first half when he curled a superb free-kick on his left foot beyond the reach of Yohann Pele and into the top-right corner of the net for his fourth goal of the season.
"The army and its allies retook control of Jabal Badro and Baadeen", both adjacent to Masaken Hanano which was retaken on Saturday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
"The army's rapid advance is due to its strategy of attacking east Aleppo on several fronts, weakening the rebels," Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said.
Meanwhile, fighting raged between regime forces and rebels in the strategic neighbouring district of Sakhur, the Observatory said.

German court upholds'Bookkeeper of Auschwitz 'conviction Berlin, Nov 28, 2016 (AFP) - A German federal court has upheld the conviction of a former Nazi SS officer known as the "Bookkeeper of Auschwitz", his lawyer said Monday, in a ruling welcomed by victims' representatives.
Oskar Groening, now 95, was found guilty in July 2015 of being an accessory to the murders of 300,000 people at the camp and sentenced to four years in prison.
But the Federal Court of Justice (BGH) threw out the appeals, meaning that the verdict by the lower tribunal in the northern city of Lueneburg is final.
The high court's decision was keenly awaited as a test of a legal precedent for prosecuting former Nazis which changed in 2011 with Germany's landmark conviction of former death camp guard John Demjanjuk.
Lawyers representing 50 co-plaintiffs said in a statement the BGH decision was "an important correction of earlier jurisprudence, even if it comes much too late".
Christoph Heubner of the Berlin-based International Auschwitz Committee, which represents camp survivors, said he was relieved by the decision. "The BGH ruling finally makes clear that everyone who was part of running Auschwitz shares responsibility and guilt," he said in a statement. "This will send a lasting message for future trials related to genocide ."
With the recount threatening to revive debate about the legitimacy of Trump's victory -- his rival Hillary Clinton won far more popular votes, while he carried the all-important Electoral College count -- Trump and his aides pushed back hard on Sunday.

Neither he nor any of his aides has offered any evidence of the "millions" alleged to have voted illegally, nor did Trump explain why he would oppose a recount if illegal voting was such a serious problem.
No election observers have pointed to any such widespread fraud.
While the recount was requested by Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who received a minute fraction of the total vote in Wisconsin, Clinton's campaign has said it would join the process despite having seen no irregularities in the White House contest so far.
"We have recounts probably almost every election.

"Fillon is closer to the voters than Alain Juppe on several issues: the fight against the Islamic state, gay marriage, and Russia," Alexei Pushkov, the member of Russian parliament's upper chamber, wrote on Twitter.
"Of course there are candidates with whom our president had the occasion to communicate more closely in recent years, and there are candidates with whom he spoke more rarely and whom he does not know as well," Peskov said.
"On the whole, next year will not be much better than this year because previously the [health care] allocations were slashed and redistributed.
The fact that they have identified four priorities - oncology, mental health, mother and child health and cardiology - which will receive larger funding maybe gives hope that there will be some reduction in the number of patients with those diseases but, on the whole, no major improvement can be expected, said the head of the association.

In past weeks, the message from the Valls camp has been that he would wait for Hollande's decision on whether to seek a second term, and would make a presidential bid of his own only if the president decided to step aside.
However, in an interview published on Sunday in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper, Valls did not rule out running against Hollande in the Socialist party primaries in January.
"I will make my decision in all conscience... Whatever happens, the best interests of the country will influence my decision," he said.
Asked if he was putting pressure on Hollande, Valls replied: "This is a very serious and historic moment for the country.
Each of us must be aware of that.
I am putting pressure on everyone ."
But people close to Hollande contacted by Reuters denied the president was about to reshuffle his cabinet.
Each would score between 13 percent and 15 percent in the first round of the presidential election, according to a Harris Interactive poll published on Sunday which showed Fillon and Le Pen contesting the second round.

1ST LEAD; Prosecutor files first indictment against soldiers over Turkish coup; By Shabtai? Gold Istanbul (dpa) - An Istanbul prosecutor filed a first indictment to a Turkish court over the July 15 failed coup, accusing 62 soldiers of involvement in the attempt, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported Monday.
The indictment, which includes charges against 28 officers, relates to a specific incident during the night, when soldiers tried to take over the Sabiha Gokcen airport on the Asian side of Istanbul.
They are charged with trying to overthrow the government and membership in an illegal armed organization.
Critics of the government accuse President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of using a state-of-emergency in place since the coup to crack down on opponents, including the media and Kurdish groups.
The country is currently suffering its worst drought since 1980, forcing Morales to declare a state of emergency a week ago.
Residents of La Paz have been without running water for two weeks and water levels in the city's three reservoirs have fallen to a third of their normal levels.
Activists are calling for protest marches in several cities on December 9th to press the government to increase investment in water resources.
Health spending in Latvia three times lower than EU average - OECD/EC report RIGA, Nov 28 (LETA) - Health spending in Latvia is about three times lower than the EU average, according to Health at a Glance: Europe 2016, a report prepared by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the European Commission.
Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria and Romania have the lowest life expectancy levels while Estonia received praise for its progress in improving life expectancy.
But the number of cancer cases remains high in the Baltic states.
Many men in the Baltics and Scandinavia have prostate cancer, and active smoking is the main reason for numerous lung cancer cases in Hungary, Croatia, Greece, Poland and Latvia.
The report said that Estonia and Latvia had made some progress in reducing the number of suicides but it was still very high.
While alcohol consumption is shrinking across the EU, it has increased in Belgium, Bulgaria, Malta, Poland, Sweden, Lithuania and Latvia in recent years.
According to the report, the quality of care has generally improved in most EU countries, yet disparities persist.
Improved treatments for life-threatening conditions such as heart attacks, strokes and several types of cancer have led to higher survival rates, but there is still room in many countries to improve the implementation of best practices in acute care and chronic care Steady improvements in population health and reductions in health inequalities can also be achieved by ensuring universal access to high-quality care.
Most EU countries have achieved universal (or near-universal) coverage of health care costs for a core set of services.
However, four EU countries (Cyprus, Greece, Bulgaria and Romania) still had more than 10 percent of their population not regularly covered for health care costs in 2014.
Ensuring effective access to health care also requires having a sufficient number and mix of health care providers in different geographic regions in the country.
Since 2000, the number of physicians per capita has increased in nearly all EU countries, on average by 20 percent (rising from 2.9 doctors per 1,000 population in 2000 to 3.5 in 2014). However, the number of specialists grew more rapidly than generalists, so that there are now more than two specialist doctors for every generalist across EU countries.
Population aging, combined with tight budgetary constraints, will require profound adaptations to the health systems of EU countries, in order to promote more healthy ageing and respond in a more integrated and patient-centerd way to growing and changing health care needs, the report said.
The army captured the Sakhur, Haydariya and Sheikh Khodr neighbourhoods on Monday, while Kurdish forces took the Sheikh Fares district from rebels, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
Europol closes 4,500 websites peddling fake brands The Hague, Nov 28, 2016 (AFP) - In a massive crackdown, police and law enforcement agencies across Europe have seized more than 4,500 website domains trading in counterfeit goods, often via social networks, officials said on Monday.
"The internet has become an essential channel for e-commerce.

But Europol warned that "despite these products looking like a bargain, they can pose serious risks to the health and safety of buyers ."
Spain arrests four men over'IS links' Madrid, Nov 28, 2016 (AFP) - Spanish police Monday arrested four men suspected of being part of an illegal immigration ring used by the Islamic State group to bring jihadists to Europe, including those involved in last year's Paris attacks.
Authorities in Spain suspect the men had been in contact with "at least one" of two alleged Islamic State extremists arrested in Salzburg, Austria shortly after the attacks in Paris in November 2015 that killed 130 people, the interior ministry said.
Investigators believe Haddadi and Usman travelled to the Greek island of Leros on October 3 on the same boat as two people, thought to be Iraqi, who blew themselves up outside the Stade de France stadium during the attacks.
But Haddadi and Usman were detained by Greek authorities for 25 days because they had fake Syrian passports.
Trump threatens to end US-Cuba thaw without'better deal' New York, Nov 28, 2016 (AFP) - President-elect Donald Trump on Monday threatened to end the US thaw with Cuba unless Havana makes concessions on human rights and opening up its economy.
Trump's hard line came just a day after his senior advisors promised to strike a "better deal" with the communist-ruled island after former leader Fidel Castro's death, without stating how this might affect the historic rapprochement begun under US President Barack Obama.
His team has said the outgoing Democratic administration made too many concessions to Havana -- notably by easing the 1962 US economic embargo -- without receiving enough concessions in areas like human rights, democracy and the move toward a free-market economy.
Asked if authorities were considering the incident to be a terror attack, Columbus police chief Kim Jacobs said that investigators were considering it to be a "possibility ."
Nine people were transported to hospitals -- eight of them in stable condition and one critical, he said.
Jacobs said there was no indication of multiple suspects in the attack, despite witness accounts suggesting several attackers were involved.
The official stressed this is early in the investigation and the sweep of campus continues.
At least eight people were taken to hospitals after an active shooter was reported on the Ohio State University campus Monday, authorities said.
One of those eight patients is in critical condition, Columbus Fire spokeswoman Rebecca Diehm said.
The routers connect customers not only to the internet, but also to telephone and television services.
The company is now looking into evidence found by IT analysts that the connection problem may have been due to an outside attack rather than a normal system failure, Telekom said late Monday morning.
"We have found the first indications that we were possibly victims of a hacker attack," a spokesman said.
The company said it was introducing a new software on Monday morning that they expected would remedy the problem, after clients - including The Local - could still not connect when the day started.

Dutch far-right MP tops polls again ahead of March vote The Hague, Nov 28, 2016 (AFP) - Far-right Dutch MP Geert Wilders was topping the polls on Monday ahead of March elections, a new survey said, appearing to have been boosted by his ongoing hate-speech trial.
According to a poll released on Sunday, if elections were held now the anti-Islam politician would take 33 seats in the 150-seat Dutch parliament.
That would make his Freedom Party (PVV) the largest group in parliament, pushing the Liberal Party of Prime Minister Mark Rutte into second place with just 25 seats -- well down on the 41 it currently has.
The Freedom Party currently holds just 12 seats in parliament.
Rutte's Liberals currently govern in a coalition with their junior partner the Labour Party (PvdA) together holding a 75-seat majority.
But he remained unapologetic when addressing the court last week as the hearings wrapped up, saying he was "not a racist".

Nevertheless, the party is determined to deal with the MEP's wrong behavior and it is only a matter of time before the board meeting is convened and the incident discussed with Grigule in person.
Grigule's vote does not reflect Latvia’s position on this matter of strategic communication, Kucinskis said.
"The fight against propaganda and demagogy will only be effective if we work together with our partners in the EU and NATO," he said.

Stein moves for Pennsylvania recount Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein is taking steps to initiate a recount in Pennsylvania, three days after filing for a recount in Wisconsin.
Recount requests were filed Monday in more than 100 Pennsylvania precincts, according to her campaign.
"The Stein recount effort is mobilizing concerned voters across Pennsylvania to request recounts in their precincts," Stein campaign manager David Cobb said in a statement. "Additionally, the campaign filed a legal petition in state court today on behalf of 100 Pennsylvania voters to protect their right to substantively contest the election in Pennsylvania beyond the recounts being filed by voters at the precinct level.
Hillary Clinton's top campaign lawyer said Saturday that the Democratic nominee's campaign would participate in the Wisconsin recount initiated by Stein, and would follow a similar approach in Michigan and Pennsylvania if she pursued recounts in those states.
"The FPOe has been toying with Austria's exit for 20 years.
Many politicians in Europe are worried that the mere speculation could trigger... an avalanche of right-wing populism," said 72-year-old Van der Bellen during the live debate broadcast on private channel ATV.
"The most important thing is the solidarity between member states, otherwise we wo n't be able to assert ourselves in the face of Russia or the United States ."
But Hofer, 45, dismissed the allegations as media-led "scare-mongering".
I've repeatedly said that I want a positive development of the EU," he said.
While Van der Bellen stressed Austria's important relationship with its largest trade partner Germany, Hofer vowed to seek closer ties with eastern and central European neighbours and, primarily, Russia.
He denounced German Chancellor Angela Merkel for "causing serious damage to Europe" with her open-door policy, which he said has allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants "including terrorists to trek through Austria" since last year.
Hofer also attacked Van der Bellen for criticising the US election win of Donald Trump.
The whole world will be watching us," said Hofer.

Viktor Yanukovych is standing as a witness in the court case of five Ukrainian riot police who are accused of opening fire at mostly unarmed people during the February 2014 revolution that turned the ex-Soviet republic toward the West.
But he fled to Russia after the bloodbath that killed more than 100 people and can not be prosecuted by the Kiev courts.
He began his testimony on Monday by accusing "the radicals of seizing power" and then "preparing to force their will on the people of the south and east who disagreed with what was happening in Kiev ."
The protests began in November 2013 in response to Yanukovych's abrupt decision to scrap a landmark pact with the EU in favour of closer Russia ties.
Ukraine has since signed the EU trade and political association agreement and blamed Russia for plotting and backing the war in reprisal for Kiev's shift out of the Kremlin's orbit.
Both the protesters and the police accuse each other of opening the fire.
A 2015 BBC documentary strongly suggested that a far-right fringe element of the protest group shot at the police in order to provoke a response and make the Berkut seem responsible for the resulting deaths.

Education and Science Employees' Union asks Vejonis not to promulgate Education Law amendments RIGA, Nov 28 (LETA) - Latvian Trade Union of Education and Science Employees and the Association of Educational Institutions' Principals are asking President Raimonds Vejonis not to promulgate the so-called teacher loyalty amendments to the Education Law that Saeima passed last week, and return them to the parliament for a repeat review.
"We believe that the Education and Science Ministry had no reason to attach the amendments to the Education Law to the 2017 state budget bill.
Including this legislation in the package of bills accompanying the budget was unjustified because the amendments do not concern budget allocations in 2017, as confirmed by a preamble to the legislation," the organizations explain.
The two organizations explain that the amendments include provisions that are incomprehensible to those working in education and science.
The amendments initiated by the ministry, and the way they have been approved by Saeima suggest that the ministry is unaware of the process of professional and constructive social dialog, and it distrusts Latvia's teachers, their professionalism, integrity, and loyalty to the State of Latvia and the Constitution.
As reported, Saeima passed the so-called teacher loyalty amendments to the Education Law in the final reading last Wednesday, establishing a set of rules for firing teachers who are found to be disloyal to the State of Latvia.
The amendments will come into force on January 1 next year.

"More than ever, there is an urgent need for a cessation of hostilities and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance", Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said in a statement on Aleppo, where tens of thousands of civilians are trapped in the fighting between government troops and rebels.
The call came as the Syrian army advanced deep inside east Aleppo, taking several neighbourhoods from the opposition in an onslaught to recapture the entire city.
"We need a Europe for the people and not only the market [...]," the agenda said.

Derrick Rose could play his way to contract security with Knicks Through 17 games, point guard Derrick Rose has shown enough progress that a lucrative new contract could be in store for him with the Knicks this summer.
I’m more concerned with trying to win games, but it’s something I’d have to talk about with my family and team.’’ According to an NBA source, the Knicks have not approached Rose about an extension, but have not ruled it out for late in the season.
The extension package would be for approximately three years, $75 million. “I haven’t talked to them about it, ’’ Rose told The Post.
Rose is the 14th-highest paid player this season at $21.3M. If he signs an extension now, next season’s salary begin at $23 million.

There have been several policy documents and projects to reach out to Latvia's Russian-speakers, but this has been largely a task for the public media, which receive additional funding for generating content meant for the Russian-speaking audiences.
Taking into consideration that Russian-speaking residents make up a significant proportion of Latvia's population, it is often assumed that non-Latvians receive information different from that received by ethnic Latvians, and the availability of Russian media in Latvia affects the way part of the Russian-speaking population feels about the developments in Latvia.
"Russian-speakers read more newspapers, they also watch Russian television channels more," says the publication.
This is because Russian-speakers have not switched to media in the Latvian language.
While public media - Latvian Television and Latvian Radio - do produce broadcasts and programs meant for Russians-speakers, these broadcasts and programs reach just a little part of the Russian-speaking audience in Latvia.
As a result, most Russian-speaking residents prefer Russian television and radio channels, not content generated by Latvia's mass media.
Russian media's effect has even increased over the past three years as Latvia-published media's circulation reduced, and the proportion of one-sided information on Russian television and radio channels increased, says the research.

The average wage in the general government sector, which includes state and local government institutions, State Social Insurance Agency and enterprises controlled and financed by the central and local governments, amounted to EUR 840 - 2.9 percent up from the third quarter of 2015.
In the third quarter of 2016, the average net wage in Latvia comprised EUR 622, 1.7 percent up from the third quarter of 2015.

In the third quarter this year, the largest average wages and salaries were recorded in financial and insurance sector, information and communication, and energy.
In turn, the lowest average wages and salaries were observed in accommodation and food service, and other service activities, as well as in the education sector.
"The drop in the average wages and salaries in the sectors of professional, scientific and technical activities, transportation and storage, and energy were affected by a reduction in the volume of irregular bonuses and premiums, as well as an increase in the number of employees, which was more rapid than the increase in the wage and salary fund.
As LETA found out in Riga Northern District Court, the prosecutor is seeking a fine of 120 minimum monthly wages, or EUR 44,000, against Loginovs, as well as ban him from working in senior jobs at state and institutions and companies for a period of three years and six months.
Likewise, Pecaks is to be imposed a fine in the amount of 90 minimum monthly wages or EUR 33,000, and banned from taking senior positions at state and municipal institutions and companies for a period of two years and eight months.
Review of the case will continue on January 4 next year, when the defendants will have the opportunity to plead their case and make the final statement.
The criminal case is based on the State Audit Office's findings several years ago, which established that the Freeport of Riga had lost at least EUR 573,314 as a result of unwarranted decisions by the freeport authority's officials.

Turkey seeks life sentences over Erdogan'assassination bid' Istanbul, Nov 29, 2016 (AFP) - Turkish prosecutors have demanded multiple life sentences for almost 50 alleged failed putschists charged with seeking to assassinate President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in a plot he says left him 15 minutes from death, state media reported Tuesday.
Erdogan, who was holidaying at a hotel in the upmarket Aegean resort of Marmaris with his family on the night of the July 15 coup, had rushed to Istanbul by plane to escape the conspiracy.
Prosecutors have sought six life sentences for each of the suspects, who include an alleged "assassination team" of 37 soldiers suspected of seeking to execute the plan. No date has yet been given for the start of the trial.

Since the death of long-time leader Yasser Arafat in 2004, Abbas has also headed the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), the internationally recognised entity representing all Palestinians.
Many analysts suggest Abbas will seek to use the five-day Fatah congress that opened Tuesday to strengthen his position and marginalise opponents.
He is unpopular with the Palestinian public -- according to a recent poll, most Palestinians want him to resign -- and faces challenges within his party. His term as president of the Palestinian Authority, which began in January 2005, expired in 2009 but he remains in place as elections have not been held. Divisions between Fatah, which controls the West Bank, and Islamist Hamas, which holds Gaza, remain deep.

"It would dramatically reduce the regime's access to hard currency used for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs," the diplomat stressed.
"We do not claim that this resolution is going to cause the DPRK to abandon its nuclear weapons program... but this resolution would make it significantly more difficult ."

But there is some evidence that this is at least tolerated or desired by the state," he added.
Chancellor Angela Merkel had said early in November that Russia could try to influence Germany's general elections next autumn through cyber attacks or disinformation campaigns.

The federal prosecutor's office said they were detained following raids on eight homes in the Charleroi area south of the capital Brussels, with police seizing several bladed weapons, some of them similar to the one used in the attack.
During the August 6 incident, a machete-wielding man assaulted the two women outside the main police station in Charleroi before being shot dead by a third officer.

Five workers sustained minor injuries.
The US Geological Survey said the magnitude 4.4 quake struck deep underground on Tuesday evening near the town of Glogow.

President Vejonis during meeting with Britain's Prince Edward calls for involvement of young people in public administration RIGA, Nov 30 (LETA) - It is necessary to promote the involvement of young people in public administration, businesses, scientific research and cultural life, Latvian President Raimonds Vejonis said during a meeting with Great Britain's Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, today.
"It is important that our countries are united not only by political and economic cooperation but also increasingly close people-to-people relations, with education, culture and sports playing a major role in their promotion," Vejonis said.
The Latvian president called to promote the involvement of as many young people in public administration, business, scientific research and cultural life as possible.
President Vejonis also told the prince about Latvia's Centenary celebrations, planned for 2018, and invited the British royal to attend the festivities.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists he hoped that "clarification will come shortly from our Turkish partners".
Peskov said Erdogan's comment "really came as news," adding that it "is not in harmony with previous statements" and "not in harmony with our understanding of the situation".
Russia has generally steered clear of any sharp criticism of the Turkish offensive.
But the Turkish army accused the Syrian regime last week of launching an airstrike that killed four Turkish soldiers in Syria, the first time it has made such a claim during the incursion.
Erdogan has repeatedly pushed for the ouster of Assad as the only solution to end the Syrian civil war and had, until recently, vehemently criticised Russia's military support for his forces and even accused President Vladimir Putin of "war crimes".
Erdogan and Putin discussed the Syria conflict on Saturday by telephone for the second time in just over 24 hours.
"The inquiry, for now, is focused on 20 individuals who... are required by the Prosecution Authority to explain or provide clarity on allegations against them," Muhumuza said in a statement late Tuesday.
Later on, "other French government agents and officials might be required to similarly assist the Kigali Prosecution Authority," Muhumuza said.
It was however not clear whether France would allow Rwanda to interview the suspects.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence pointed to a statement issued by Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on November 16 after Kigali released a list of 22 French officers accused of being implicated in the genocide.
He said there was "nothing new" in the list that resembled one released in 2008, and added that, "to say the French army took part in the genocide is a despicable lie ."
France has been accused of ignoring the warning signs of the genocide, and of training soldiers and militiamen who participated in the killings.
Rwanda's decision to investigate French officials came a month after French investigators reopened an inquiry into the crash of a plane carrying Rwanda's then-president Juvenal Habyarimana, for which some Hutus blamed the Tutsis, sparking the genocide.
Report: Alleged Israeli strikes hit Syrian post west of Damascus Damascus (dpa) - Loud blasts, believed to be the result of Israeli airstrikes, rocked areas west of the Syrian capital, Damascus, early Wednesday, a pro-Syrian regime website and a monitoring group reported.

The Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, which is being updated during a three-day meeting in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Abeba, includes expressions of culture that testify to the diversity of heritage around the globe.
In Belgium, where almost 1500 types of beer are produced, making and appreciating beer is part of the living heritage of a range of communities, UNESCO said.
Cuba's rumba dance is part of the world cultural heritage because it features elements of African and Antillean cultures as well as Spanish flamenco. UNESCO also added to the list the celebration of the New Year on March 21, shared by 12 countries, including Afghanistan, India, Iran and Turkey.
Ukraine warns Russia of rocket tests near Crimea Kiev, Nov 30, 2016 (AFP) - Ukraine ratcheted up tensions with Moscow on Wednesday by warning the Kremlin its military intended to hold two days of rocket launching exercises near the border with Russian-annexed Crimea.
Ukraine also failed to say whether the tests would involve specific targets or if the rockets would only be fired into the air.
Moscow-based RIA Novosti state news agency earlier quoted Russia's aviation authority as saying that Ukraine's rockets would even approach the Crimean capital of Simferopol.
"The Kremlin would not like to see any sorts of actions from Ukraine that contradict international law," spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow.
He added that the tests could "create dangerous conditions for international flights crossing the territory of Russia and neighbouring regions".
"The public service remit for the next three years stipulates setting up an independent interactive channel through a partnership between Latvian Television and Latvian Radio.
If funding is allocated for the purpose, we are planning to implement the project in 2018," said Kezbere, adding that the main problem at the moment was that funds from the state budget had not yet been allotted for the project.
"The objective of the channel is to inform, educate, and involve people who are not ethnic Latvians in the developments in the country," said Kezbere.
These are people of various nationalities, including Poles, Belarusians, Ukrainians, who live in Latvia and who understand Russian better than Latvian. At the moment, Latvia does not have a television targeting specifically the Russian-speaking audience, said Kezbere.
Latvian Television's Channel 7 has a couple of hours a day for broadcasts in Russian - which is good, yet not enough to reach the Russian-speaking audience.

EU court upholds some sanctions on Putin judo partner Rotenberg Luxembourg, Nov 30, 2016 (AFP) - An EU court on Wednesday upheld some of the sanctions imposed on Arkady Rotenberg, tycoon and judo sparring partner of Russian President Vladimir Putin, for his role in the Ukraine crisis.
As the crisis deepened in early 2014 with Russia's annexation of Crimea, the EU imposed asset freezes and travel bans on Russian and Ukrainian figures it blamed for breaking up the country, among them Rotenberg.
He appealed against the sanctions to the General Court of the European Union, second to the European Court of Justice, saying Brussels had imposed them illegally.
In its ruling, the General Court said it partly upheld Rotenberg's action and annulled the sanctions for the period July 30, 2014 to March 14, 2015 because the EU legal reasoning was at fault.
The sanctions were subsequently renewed from March 15, 2015 for six month periods but with additional reasons given -- that Rotenberg was the owner of a company building a bridge between Crimea and Russia, and that he headed a public relations effort to reinforce Moscow's claims to the peninsular.
The president-elect wrote on Twitter that he will hold a "major" press conference on the matter on December 15 in New York, in which his family will also be present.

Recently, an important event took place within the Latvian armed forces - the development plan of the armed forces for the upcoming 12 years was approved.
Already next year, Latvia will host a larger number of allied soldiers, which is why the work you do domestically and internationally is very important," Bergmanis said.

According to the prime minister, there will be many challenges ahead in regards to the Rail Baltica project, but there will also be even more opportunities.
It is important for the Baltics not to repeat the mistakes made in the past, when disagreements amongst one another hindered the implementation of joint project.
Rail Baltica must become a symbol of Baltic unity," Kucinskis said.
''Only together can the Baltics achieve this goal, so that in 2025 residents will be able to travel from Tallinn to Kaunas via Riga on Rail Baltica, and further onto Europe," Kucinskis said.

Trump claims mirror conspiracy-pushing website Washington, Nov 30, 2016 (AFP) - Some of the most incendiary claims made by Donald Trump -- both before and after his election -- appear to be based on a US website denounced as a purveyor of hoaxes and conspiracy theories.
It was not the first time Trump had repeated information reported in infowars, a site operated by radio host Alex Jones, who is known for claims that the 9/11 attacks were faked by the US government.
Left-leaning media watchdog group Media Matters for America has documented dozens of instances where Trump has recycled claims from Jones and infowars.
"A lot of what he (Jones) says is just pure nonsense," said Angelo Carusone of Media Matters.
"What he is presenting is an alternative universe.
He is advancing a broader world view that there is a global world government and every day they are going out there to take away your power ."
- Fear of sharia - For example, Carusone said that infowars ran "completely fabricated" stories saying that Muslims were imposing sharia law in US cities.
"If the president believes that and starts to make policy based on the belief that we have sharia law, we have a problem," said Carusone.
Trump was interviewed during the campaign by Jones, who also claimed to have had several phone conversations with the Republican billionaire, raising concerns about influence on policy.

He has a criminal record that includes aggravated theft, dealing cocaine, drink driving and failure to pay child support.

UN Security Council strengthens North Korea sanctions United Nations, United States, Nov 30, 2016 (AFP) - The United Nations Security Council on Wednesday voted unanimously to tighten sanctions against North Korea following its most recent nuclear test, placing a cap on Pyongyang's coal exports to China.
The resolution aims to curb North Korea's coal exports -- the top external revenue source for the impoverished state -- by more than 60 percent, a US official said earlier.
The official voiced hope that the resolution would cut $700 million from North Korea's coal earnings, dramatically reducing the money it can use on nuclear and ballistic weapons.
China has traditionally protected North Korea diplomatically, believing that Kim Jong-Un's regime is preferable to its collapse, but has increasingly grown frustrated by the state's defiance.
The UN Security Council resolution condemns "in the strongest terms" North Korea's latest test on September 9.
Competition Council to look into Vesko operator's plan to take over Mego retail chain RIGA, Nov 30 (LETA) - The Competition Council will look into the plan of Baltstor, the owner of Vesko retail chain, to acquire Mego grocery chain, LETA was told at the council.
As a result of the deal, Baltstor, the owner of Bauskas Tirgotajs which in the retail market operates under the Vesko brand, will take over the Lenoka stores operating under the Mego brand.
Since the Competition Council can only release basic information about the acquisition deal, it is not giving more detailed comments for now.
The Competition Council has one month to decide whether to authorize the deal or not, but if an in-depth analysis is needed, the deliberation time can be extended to three months.
According to information from Firmas.lv. Baltstor, registered in 2004, is a partner and coordinator of Mego and Vesko brands.
The wage rise has been exceeding productivity for a fourth consecutive year, making economists worry about the competitiveness of the economy and sustainability of growth.
If wages continued to grow at the previous pace, even as economic growth slows, it would indicate that we have disturbed the macroeconomic balance (similar as during 2005 – 2007), the economy has over heated and a painful downward correction should be expected in the future," he went on to say.
''Yet the current situation when wages are reacting flexibly to the output dynamics, is an additional argument in favor of us still being close to macroeconomic balance: the output gap is close to zero and unemployment is close to its natural level.
Thus we have no reason to fear future and focus instead to supply-side economics in order to achieve a faster growth of the potential gross domestic product, i.e. continue to raise wages and living standard in a sustainable way," Krasnopjorovs added.
Average monthly gross wage in the private sector increased 2.3 percent to EUR 828, and average wage in the public sector rose 1.9 percent to EUR 885.
In the third quarter of 2016, the average net wage in Latvia comprised EUR 622, 1.7 percent up from the third quarter of 2015.

Necessary properties in Riga will begin to be expropriated next year for Rail Baltica construction RIGA, Nov 30 (LETA) - Agnis Driksna, the director of the Development and Cooperation Department at Eiropas Dzelzcela Linija, said that the necessary properties in Riga will begin to be expropriated next year for the construction of the Rail Baltic high-speed rail line.
During a special press conference today, Driksna said that 2016 was an important year for the Rail Baltica project, as the rail line's final route was finally agreed upon after two years worth of discussions.
In regards to the expropriation process, Driksna explained that the owners of the properties will be informed, which will be followed by a real-estate property evaluation so that these owners could be adequately compensated.

Europol red-faced as terror data appears online The Hague, Nov 30, 2016 (AFP) - Europol admitted on Wednesday that confidential information on terror investigations were accidentally put online, as it launched a probe into what it called a "very serious incident ."
Dutch investigative TV programme Zembla, which broke the story, said around 700 pages on terror investigations -- particularly analysis on terror groups -- appeared online, including the names and contact details of hundreds of people with terror links.
"A security investigation in coordination with the respective authorities at national level is ongoing... (but) current information suggests that the breach was not ill-intended," he said.

CIA chief warns Trump against ripping up Iran deal London, United Kingdom, Nov 30, 2016 (AFP) - CIA director John Brennan warned Wednesday that tearing up the Iran nuclear deal, as US President-elect Donald Trump promised during his election campaign, would be "disastrous".
"I think it would be the height of folly if the next administration were to tear up that agreement," Brennan told the BBC, adding: "It would be disastrous, it really would ."
He said it would be "almost unprecedented" for one administration to tear up an agreement made by a previous one.
Brennan warned "it could lead to a weapons programme inside of Iran that could lead other states in the region to embark on their own programmes, with military conflict".
The memorandum envisages working out favorable conditions for the development of intermodal container transportation, using innovative technology and combined transport, as well as cooperation with the countries' customs authorities, to ensure that they are informed about the planned shipments in advance to speed up the process.
The cooperation framework also provides for joint market research and exchange of information on the situation in the logistics sector.
Latvijas Dzelzcels CEO Edvinds Berzins said that the diversification of rail cargo and expansion to new markets is one of the Latvian company's strategic goals.
Transcontainer CEO Petr Baskakov said that this cooperation is significant to the company as it will allow for providing convenient cargo delivery service from China to European countries.
"We tested this project, and it showed respectable results.
Secondly, it gives us the opportunity to ship import cargo from Latvia to Russia, thus expanding the scope of cooperation.
The document that has been signed today will promote further development of container transportation by rail both in Latvia and Russia," Baskakov said.

“We are ready to take on Marco Huck as Mairis is really interested in that fight, ” Siesta exclusively told World Boxing News.
“Nobody at the WBC has confirmed that Marco is the one who will be fighting Mairis if the belt becomes vacant, but we hope it’ll be Huck as we like the fight.
“I had few preliminary discussions with Karsten Mahlmann, who is a managing advisor for team Huck and he’s a very straightforward, constructive individual who understands our business and looking for a sincere resolution that satisfies everyone.
“Huck is a massive headliner on one of the biggest television channels in Germany, RTL that is an equivalent to UK’s ITV.
“Both Mairis and Marco are interested in fighting Tony Bellew next, regardless of his outcome against Haye.
If Eddie Hearn and Sky, for whatever reason feel that there’s a commercial value in bringing Briedis versus Huck to the UK then maybe it will go on the undercard of Bellew vs Haye.
"If we do n't resolve basic problems of the Russian economy, if we do n't fully launch new factors for growth, then we could hover around zero for years, pushing us to constantly shrink, economise and delay our development," he said in an annual state of the union speech.."

The government looking into deep spending cuts to reduce the budget deficit.
Critics have called for structural reforms for years, but Russia continues to depend heavily on its exports of natural resources such as oil, while investment has been deeply affected by Western sanctions over Ukraine.
Putin, who first took charge of the country in 2000, on Thursday complained of "shortaqes of investment resources, modern technology and professional personnel" as well as "inadequately developed competition and flaws in the business climate ."
"Keeping European unity towards Russia in the conflict with Ukraine, and more broadly also in global issues, was possible also thanks to the large support from President Obama," Tusk told Polish TVN24 broadcaster.
Tusk, a former Polish prime minister, also said that many public statements from Trump have reflected a different attitude toward Europe, NATO and Russia from his predecessors.
"I would say the conversation was rather general in nature," Tusk said.
"It was longer than I expected but Trump's attention focused rather on Brexit that on eastern issues ."
Football: Southampton stun Arsenal in League Cup London, Nov 30, 2016 (AFP) - Southampton dealt Arsenal a shock defeat in the English League Cup quarter-finals on Wednesday as goals from Jordy Clasie and Ryan Bertrand earned Claude Puel's side a 2-0 win.

China to'seriously 'implement N. Korea UN sanctions Beijing, Dec 1, 2016 (AFP) - Beijing will "seriously" implement new United Nations sanctions imposed on North Korea over its nuclear and missile programmes, it said Thursday, with the measures set to hit Pyongyang's lucrative Chinese coal exports hard.
UN Security Council resolution 2321, passed on Wednesday, caps the North's annual coal exports at little more than four months of current sales to China, Chinese government data shows.
China imported 1.8 million tonnes of coal worth $101 million from North Korea in October alone, according to the most recent figures available on the Chinese Customs website. The volume was up nearly 40 percent year-on-year.
Beijing will "serious" implement the resolution, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters at a regular briefing.
China, a veto-wielding permanent Security Council member, had a "responsible attitude", he added, and had always implemented UNSC resolutions and fulfilled "its international obligations according to the UN charter".
Trade with the world's second largest economy is crucial for the isolated and impoverished North, which has suffered regular food shortages and an outright famine in the mid-1990s.
The North's coal exports to the Asian giant have continued unabated despite previous UN sanctions, which included exemptions allowing trade to continue for "livelihood" purposes but did not set criteria for the determination.

Rooney, 31, apologised after being pictured looking the worse for wear as he mingled with wedding guests at the England team hotel in the early hours during the most recent international break.
"Wayne Rooney is the England captain," Southgate told reporters at Wembley.
"When I played for England at Euro 96, there were leaders throughout the team.
Wayne has played an important part up to this point, but we also need to develop others ."

Britain to brief foreign press on Brexit to counter'misreporting' London, Dec 1, 2016 (AFP) - British Prime Minister Theresa May's office will hold regular briefings with foreign journalists from early next year to counter "misreporting" about its plans for Brexit, a spokeswoman said Thursday.
The government has repeatedly said it will not give a "running commentary" on its negotiating strategy for Brexit, but the absence of any clear position has forced many observers to rely on speculation and reports in Britain's largely eurosceptic press.
Brexit minister David Davis defended the government's approach Thursday, telling lawmakers that "the probable success of the negotiations depend very greatly on us being able to manage the information and keep what needs to be secret until the last minute secret".
First Israeli ambassador to Turkey since 2010 arrives Ankara, Dec 1, 2016 (AFP) - Israel's new ambassador to Turkey arrived in the capital Ankara on Thursday, an Israeli embassy official said, to serve as the first official envoy since a six-year spat put diplomatic relations on ice.
Naeh is due to present his letter of credence to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in the next few days.
A career diplomat, he previously worked at the embassy in Ankara from 1993 to 1997.
Thanking Ankara for its support and the warm welcome, Naeh told reporters at the airport: "We have a history of helping each other in times of need ."
Turkey this month appointed Prime Minister Binali Yildirim's foreign affairs advisor Kemal Okem as its ambassador to Israel.
The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) imposed its initial ban on Russia in November 2015 and has twice extended it, in March and June, on the grounds that the criteria set for the track and field powerhouses to be reincluded had not been met.
The Russian athletics federation (RusAF) "has made further progress towards satisfying the reinstatement conditions since June 2016", said Norwegian Rune Andersen, the head of the IAAF Taskforce looking into the steps Russia is taking to combat doping.
In the meantime, Russian athletes can still apply to the IAAF doping review board to compete if they can demonstrate they have undergone a testing system, as the US-based long jumper Darya Klishina did successfully for the Rio Games. The ban has led to Russian athletes missing the Olympics in Brazil and its current extension means the bulk of them will also likely miss the March 3-5 European Indoor Championships in Belgrade.
"I hope that by the spring qualifications for the World Championship, which will be held in 2017 in Lausanne, our athletics (federation) will be reinstated," Russian news agencies quoted deputy prime minister Vitaly Mutko as saying.
The German version will be edited from France by a 33-year-old from Berlin who on the advice of her colleagues uses a pseudonym, Minka Schneider.
Schneider, speaking to Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily, recalled that the "Je suis Charlie" (I am Charlie) solidarity movement was especially strong in Germany, where the magazine sold 70,000 copies of its "survivors' edition" one week after the shootings.
The cover asserts that auto giant Volkswagen, hit by its emissions cheating scandal, "stands behind Merkel", showing the chancellor lying atop a hydraulic ramp, with a mechanic commenting that "with a new exhaust, she'll be good to go another four years".
Charlie Hebdo features humour "as subtle as a steamroller" and its "impudence, especially when dealing with the religions, is legendary," the newspaper said.
It's a measure that might run counter to President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to improve U.S. relations with Moscow.
Both the House and Senate versions of the bill call for setting up a new, interagency panel to stifle Russian attempts to "exert covert influence over peoples and governments ."
The bill says the committee would be charged with "countering active measures by Russia to exert covert influence, including exposing falsehoods, agents of influence, corruption, human rights abuses, terrorism and assassinations carried out by the security services or political elites of the Russian Federation or their proxies ."
The Senate is expected to vote on the intelligence bill before the end of this year's session.
The measure funds efforts to foil attacks and deny terrorists safe harbor in Iraq, Syria, North Africa and other places in the world. It bolsters counter-intelligence and addresses threats from adversaries in cyberspace, space and at sea.

Crashed Chapecoense soccer team jet'out of fuel moments before crash' DW A leaked recording reveals the pilot of the plane carrying a Brazilian soccer team admitted being out of fuel before it crashed.
The pilot of the British-built jet could be heard repeatedly requesting permission to land due to a "total electric failure" and lack of fuel.
Colombian civil aviation director Alberto Bocanegra told RCN Radio that an empty fuel tank was one hypothesis being examined.
Bocanegra said investigators were reviewing the plane's flight recorders and the air traffic control voice recording. He said if the plane had run out of fuel, it would indicate an "act of negligence" by the pilot, who was responsible for ensuring fuel supplies were adequate for the trip. Planes are required to have enough extra fuel on board to fly at least 30 to 45 minutes to another airport in the case of an emergency.
The airline director Gustavo Vargas told Bolivian television that the plane may have skipped a planned refueling stop in northern Bolivia because the airport was closed.

As LETA was informed by the Presidential Press Service, the president previously pointed out that it is important for the next NAF commander to be an authority figure within the armed forces, as well as having experience heading the command and headquarters, in addition to international experience.
In the letter, Vejonis emphasized that Kalnins has made a considerable contribution to the NAF and gained much experience, including within the Home Guard.
Meanwhile, Defense Ministry spokesman Kaspars Galkins told LETA that it is too early to speak about who might replace Kalnins as the next commander of the Joint Headquarters of the Latvian National Armed Forces, as Saeima must still approve Kalnins as chief of defense.

Double currency regimes usually foresee a weaker currency used for domestic transactions, pension and salary payments, and a stronger one for external trade.
Communist Cuba is one of the few countries that has such a set up.
"I think the euro was an ill-conceived project that benefited neither Italy nor Europe.
However, I do not at all wish for an Italian exit, at this stage it would be further failure," Berlusconi told Il Foglio newspaper.
"I rather consider as feasible the double currency idea put forward by several economists.
[We should adopt] a parallel currency [...] that would partly restore our monetary sovereignty without leaving the euro system," he said.
E-health system is working, ERDF funding will not be lost - health minister's advisor RIGA, Dec 1 (LETA) - The e-health system is working, and financing allocated for the project from the European Regional Development Fund will not be lost, as Health Minister Anda Caksa's advisor Ilze Abolina said in an interview with LETA.
However, to make a project function is one thing, while to achieve that intended users actually use it is a different thing altogether, and it is the latter that indicates whether the project is successful, said Abolina.
Tomorrow, December 2, the Health ministry's e-health system will also be presented at the Environmental Protection and Regional Development Ministry, which will be appraising the product's functionality until the end of the year.
An Institute of Race Relations analysis of 134 racist incidents reported in the media in the month after the vote has found 51 of these either specifically referred to the referendum or messages used during the campaign.
"Just go home.
You will have to leave the country soon," a man told one eastern European woman, in another of numerous examples cited by the Institute.
Violence was also directed at those who supported Britain remaining in the EU, with one campaigner having the windows of their business smashed, the Institute said.
The charity found 93 of the cases analysed featured a white British perpetrator, while two people were listed as black and in 39 cases the ethnicity was unknown.
The Institute criticised the policies of both Conservative and Labour governments, as well as British media reporting on immigration, as laying the groundwork for hate crime after the referendum.
"Our thesis is that the spike in race hatred has had a direct impetus from the divisive approach to race, religion and migration which is now official policy.
"To put it simply, if a hostile environment is embedded politically, why should we be surprised when it takes root culturally ?"
While there are a few things that still have to be improved, Wynnyk is confident that Canadian soldiers will be well provided in Latvia, Wynnyk said during his visit to Latvia.
On the other hand, Latvian Chief of Defense, Lieutenant General Raimonds Graube notes that Canada's willingness to discuss matters that deal with the deployment of the battle group to Latvia at the highest level proves how well Canada understands the geopolitical security situation.
At the end of January, a Latvian delegation will visit Ottawa to discuss the legal and operational details of the multinational battalion's deployment to Latvia with experts from the other countries whose soldiers will be deployed to Latvia.
As reported, NATO leaders at the summit in Warsaw in July approved the deployment of four multinational battalions to the Baltic countries and Poland as part of measures meant to deter Russia from possible aggression.
The NATO battalion of around 1,000 multinational troops is scheduled to arrive in Latvia next spring. Half of the battalion will be Canadian soldiers, and it will also include soldiers from Albania, Italy, Poland and Slovenia.

"The result everywhere is the same: human tragedies and victims, decay and ruin, disappointment ."
Colombian Congress ratifies peace deal with FARC Bogota, Dec 1, 2016 (AFP) - Colombia's Congress on Wednesday unanimously approved a peace deal with FARC guerrillas to end more than a half-century of civil war, lawmakers said.
The House of Representatives voted 130-0 to approve the text adopted a day earlier by the Senate.
President Juan Manuel Santos said the vote provided "landmark backing" for the peace he pushed.
Santos, this year's Nobel Peace Prize winner, shepherded the revised deal through Congress after voters shocked the world by rejecting an earlier version in a referendum last month.
Two FARC fighters and several local activists have been killed since the ceasefire went into force on August 29, triggering fears it could collapse.
Rival protests were held in front of Congress on Wednesday by both advocates and opponents of the deal.
Karosta Prison amongst world's most unusual accommodation establishments VENTSPILS, Dec 1 (LETA) - The Karosta Prison in Liepaja has been included amongst the world's most unusual accommodation establishments by the well-known publisher of tourism guidebooks Where Traveler, LETA was informed by Karosta Rescue Association board member Monta Krafte.
At Karosta Prison in Latvia, guests can sleep in a cell, eat like a prisoner and get insulted like a prisoner. It is all part of the living history experience.
According to Krafte, 319 people spent the night at Karosta Prison last year.
It will feature an interior reproducing some of the grandeur of the original including a ballroom, theatre, swimming pool and first-class cabins, with the addition of wifi, said Wuchang Shipbuilding Industry Group's deputy general manager Wang Weiling.
The new ship will be the centrepiece of a theme park hundreds of kilometres (miles) from China's coast bankrolled by Chinese energy company Seven Star Energy Investment Group.
The company first announced plans for the 1 billion yuan ($150 million) project in 2014.
The ship's design is based on the original, and construction will involve assistance from US and British designers and technicians, Xinhua said.
Domestic tourism is booming in China, promoted by the government as a way of fuelling consumer-driven growth rather than its decades-old model of investment and industry.
Theme parks are being built in the country faster than anywhere else in the world, with more than 300 projects reportedly funded in recent years.
Human ancestor Lucy spent much of her time in trees: study Washington, Dec 1, 2016 (AFP) - Lucy, the ancient ancestor of modern humans, probably spent at least a third of her day nesting in trees, according to new research unveiled Wednesday.
They have been debating whether the 60-pound (27 kilogram) hominid spent most of her time on the ground, like modern humans, or in the trees, like chimpanzees.
The study finds that Lucy had strong upper arms, suggesting she regularly climbed trees.
She also had relatively week legs that were not used for climbing and were inefficient for walking.
The combination of the two discoveries led researchers to conclude that Lucy probably nested in tree branches at night in order to avoid predators, used her arms to travel between trees and may have even foraged for food among branches.
"It is a well-established fact that the skeleton responds to loads during life, adding bone to resist high forces and subtracting bone when forces are reduced," said John Kappelman, an anthropology professor at the University of Texas, and one of the main authors of the research.
The study, published in the British magazine Nature, arrived at that conclusion after analyzing a bone fracture in Lucy's fossilized remains.
Long considered the longest living human relative, Lucy was dethroned of her status in 1994 following the discovery -- also in Ethiopia -- of Ardi, a female Ardipithecus ramidus who lived 4.5 million years ago.
President urges to learn courage and heroism from the events from the past on Black Coffee Evening RIGA, Dec 1 (LETA) - Commemorating the 14 Military School cadets which fell during the Latvian War of Independence on Black Coffee Night yesterday, President Raimonds Vejonis said that"we can learn love of the homeland, invincible spirit, and confident heart from the events from the past", LETA was informed by the Presidential Press Service.
“Today, we symbolically commemorate 14 cadets, young boys, of the Military School fallen during the Latvian War of Independence, who died for their country.
They fell in a battle lost, but they did not lack either courage or heroism, and that exactly influenced the outcome of the entire war, as the Bermondt army was evicted from Latvia, ” said Vejonis at the special event at the National Defense Academy.
The president admitted that current young cadets could immediately start with learning, growth, and self-perfection by avoiding the bloody experience of the cadets in 1919.
Vejonis confirmed that Latvia would continue to be a reliable ally for anyone who advocated the same democratic values whereon our country was based.
EU immigration surged before Brexit referendum London, Dec 1, 2016 (AFP) - A record 284,000 EU citizens arrived in Britain in the year to June when the Brexit referendum was held, with a particularly high number coming from Romania and Bulgaria, official data showed on Thursday.
Net migration to Britain -- the total of all migrant arrivals minus departures -- was at a near-record of 335,000, far above the government's target of 100,000.
The period covered by the data goes to only a few days after the June 23 vote meaning it was "too early to say what effect, if any, the EU referendum has had," said Nicola White, head of international migration at the Office for National Statistics.
"Immigration levels are now among the highest estimates recorded," she said, adding that Romania was the most common country of previous residence in 2015, making up for 10 percent of the total.
The influx of workers from Eastern Europe over the past decade was a key driving factor behind the Brexit vote and Prime Minister Theresa May has promised to cut down on EU immigration.

If progress slows, the consequences could be devastating, UNICEF said, warning that funding for AIDS response has decreased since 2014.
AIDS is one of the leading causes of death among teens, claiming 41,000 lives in 2015 alone, UNICEF said.
"The world has made tremendous progress in the global effort to end AIDS, but the fight is far from over - especially for children and adolescents," said Anthony Lake, UNICEF's executive director.

Netanyahu's wife grilled on suspected misuse of funds Jerusalem, Dec 1, 2016 (AFP) - Israeli police questioned the wife of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday over allegations that the couple used public funds to cover their personal outgoings, local media reported.
"New information has reached the police according to which there is a growing evidentiary basis on which to prosecute Mrs Netanyahu," Israeli public radio reported.
Media in May said police recommended charging Sara Netanyahu, but not her husband, in what is widely referred to as the "prime minister's residences affair ."
Sara Netanyahu was grilled in December 2015 over claims the couple billed the state for the cost of garden furniture and electrical repairs at their private villa in the exclusive coastal resort of Caesarea.
A former butler has also accused Sara Netanyahu of pocketing cash from deposit refunds for empty bottles returned from the official residence between 2009 and 2013, money that should have gone to the treasury.
The Netanyahus have dismissed the allegations, widely circulated in the local media, as a smear campaign.

Estonia sends political calendar of EU presidency to fellow member states TALLINN, Dec 01, BNS - The first version of the political calendar of the Estonian presidency of the Council of the European Union reached member states and EU institutions on Thursday.
She said an updated version of the calendar will be published in spring 2017.
The presidency will start with a visit of EU commissioners to Estonia at the end of June.
Simultaneously with commissioners about a hundred foreign journalists, most of whom are based in Brussels, will visit Estonia.
From July to October 11 informal ministerial meetings of the EU and up to seven high level international conferences will take place at the Kultuurikatel venue for cultural events in Tallinn, bringing together approximately 2,500 participants.
''Looking at GDP from the expenditure side, the situation is mainly determined by low investment activity, which, for a third consecutive quarter, has made a negative contribution to economic growth.
The diminished investment in 2016 can be explained mostly by delayed absorption of the European Union (EU) structural funds. This is particularly evident by the contraction of investment in non-residential buildings and infrastructure as the projects from the previous planning period were finalized and the uptake of the new period appropriations was delayed," he said.
''The situation in the construction sector proves the point as the drop was most substantial in the construction of engineering structures.
Even though the situation is rather grim, it seems that the lowest point may have been reached and from now on a moderate recovery in the flow of EU structural funds can be expected.
A positive sign is the rise in government investments in October (11% year-on-year), which is a substantial improvement over the first nine months of the year (a drop of 30%).
Thus a gradual rise in construction and investment activities is expected, which, however, is likely to be too small to compensate for the drop seen so far.
It can be expected that along with faster economic growth and return to higher wage growth, the private consumption will continue to grow steadily.
Compared to the first half of the year, the increase in goods and services imports has diminished substantially – to a great extent because of the low investment activity (evident in falling imports of capital goods).
The quarter-on-quarter growth rate (seasonally adjusted) was negative in manufacturing, energy, transport, financial services as well as education sector.
The fact that GDP retained quarter-on-quarter growth, albeit tiny, was determined by the slight rise in trade and the relatively strong increase in real estate sector," he said.

Latvia needs well thought-out tax and remuneration policies - Baldzens RIGA, Dec 1 (LETA) - The Free Trade Union Confederation of Latvia deputy chairman Egils Baldzens, a candidate to become the next head of the confederation, believes that Latvia needs to adopt a well thought-out tax policy, have adequate wages and capital gains tax, as Baldzens said in an interview with LETA.
In the next few years, it will be impossible for Latvia to avoid systematic wage growth. If wages do not increase, Latvia will continue to lose economically-active residents - people who grow up and received education here, believes Badzens.
"We have to employ many different methods so the presence of trade unions increase where we already are represented, and new unions be founded where there are none at the moment," emphasizes Baldzens.
The unions have to become stronger in the private sector, and employees in the private sector have to sign collective agreements with employers.
Employers will always have more opportunities to influence the government's decisions, but unions, given the number of union members, also can influence the government, notes Baldzens.
It is important to balance out the interests of employers and employees.
The government, municipalities, employers and trade unions have to learn to work in harmony with each other, which is not the case at the moment.
There also are disagreements in the ruling coalition.
We will be trying to replace them with people from other countries, who will need little time to figure out that living conditions are better and wages higher in Germany, Norway, France, Denmark or some other Western country.
We will try to school immigrants, teach them Latvian and European Union values, that is, we will become a place to raise their qualifications.
This can not be our goal," says Baldzens.
"Wages and taxes have to be such that children do not become a burden, forcing people to look for jobs abroad.
At the moment, 70 percent to 80 percent of high school students say that they will work abroad.

LETA and Deutsche Welle to build prototype for automated video news translation RIGA, Dec 2 (LETA) - Latvian information agency LETA and German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle, using Google language technologies, will build a prototype for automated video news translation.
The joint LETA and Deutsche Welle project, Speech.Media has been offered EUR 50,000 funding from the second round of Google Digital News Initiative Innovation Fund.
The way people perceive the news is changing because of Google and Facebook, and this has a profound effect on how news stories are disseminated, explains the University of Latvia Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science leading researcher and LETA Research Laboratory head Guntis Barzdins.
Commenting on the Speech.Media project, Barzdins said that Deutsche Welle was producing news in thirty languages.
Deutsche Welle also produces video news, hence the project, which in essence aims to develop a tool recognizing speech in one language and rendering it in another language - or adding subtitles in another language, explained Barzdins.
Speech.Media will be a comparatively short pilot project, it could commence next February and continue for six months.
The project does not aim to cover all thirty languages used at Deutsche Welle, the tool will be used for tests on two or three languages.
During the second round of Google Digital News Initiative Innovation Fund, a total of EUR 24 million has been distributed among 124 projects in 25 European countries.

Vienna (dpa) - Europe will look to Austria on Sunday to see if the small but wealthy country will elect Western Europe's first far-right president, giving a fresh boost to populists in the wake of Britain's Brexit vote and Donald Trump's win in the United States.
But even if rightist Norbert Hofer loses and his left-leaning Green rival Alexander Van der Bellen wins the hotly contested presidential race, populism would only suffer a temporary setback rather than a defeat. This is because Hofer's Freedom Party is poised to win the next parliamentary election, and its anti-immigration views have been adopted by mainstream parties.
However, the opposition Freedom Party successfully challenged the vote in the Constitutional Court by bringing evidence that ballots were counted without proper oversight in many towns.
The court ordered a repeat election, which was planned to go ahead in October but had to be pushed back to December after the envelopes for postal votes were found to be manufactured with substandard glue.
Hofer, one of the deputy presidents of Austria's parliament, has won support from half of the voters by criticizing the government for allowing 90,000 migrants to enter the country last year.
"By announcing'We can do it, 'she [Merkel] encouraged many people to undertake very, very dangerous journeys across the sea,"? he said in a recent television debate.
Following Britain's referendum decision to leave the European Union, Freedom Party leaders welcomed Brexit and said that Austria should hold a similar vote if Turkey were to be admitted into the European Union, or if the bloc proved to be incapable of reforming itself.
However, Austrians have little appetite for exiting the bloc, and the EU-sceptic Freedom Party has since backpedalled.
Hofer told dpa that he sees the EU? as "a project that is in urgent need of development.
Former Green party chief Van der Bellen is pro-European. He keeps warning that Hofer's recent soft EU? stance only masks his wish to destroy the bloc, in line with like-minded populist movements in France and Germany.
The Freedom Party has led the polls for more than a year and currently enjoys the support of 35 per cent of voters, according to the latest survey published by the tabloid Oesterreich in early November.

"It's a very subtle thing, a very subtle line.
It depends on a feeling of tact, from all of us: officialdom on the one hand and people in creative professions on the other," he said.
"Those activists -- I'm speaking approximately -- at Charlie Hebdo's offices, they came and shot people.
Orthodox activists this year campaigned to close a provincial staging of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical "Jesus Christ Superstar".

Bulgaria facing fresh elections after PM cabinet refusal Sofia, Dec 2, 2016 (AFP) - Bulgaria is facing fresh elections next spring after outgoing Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, leader of the largest party in parliament, on Friday refused to form a new cabinet.
The tough-guy premier resigned in November after his candidate was beaten by a Moscow-friendly general in presidential elections, sparking renewed political instability in the EU's poorest country, where no other party can currently form a government without the support of Borisov's conservative GERB party.
"I will not propose to form a new government and I hand back the mandate," Borisov told President Rosen Plevneliev at a ceremony in Sofia.
Under Bulgaria's constitution, the outgoing president will hand another mandate next Thursday to the second largest party, Socialist BSP, and then pick a third party for a final attempt to avert a snap vote.
Bulgaria's president-elect, the Socialist-backed former air force general Rumen Radev, will take office only in January so the outgoing Plevneliev will have to appoint a caretaker administration until then.
Auschwitz medic's trial can go ahead after bias motions dismissed Waren, Germany (dpa)? - The trial of a 96-year-old former medic at the Auschwitz death camp can go ahead after several motions to dismiss the judge for bias were thrown out, a court spokesman said Friday.
The trial of Hubert Zafke, who is charged with at least 3,681 counts of accessory to murder, will now be rescheduled for early 2017, the Brandenburg-based spokesman said without giving further details.
His trial started in March, but was suspended in October when the prosecution team and co-plaintiffs accused judge Klaus Kabisch of a" lack of objectivity" in the case.
That approach changed radically after a legal precedent set by the 2011 conviction of John Demjanjuk, who was found guilty by a Munich court of being an accessory to the murder of more than 28,000 Jews while he was a guard at the Sobibor camp in occupied Poland.

Alexander Hug of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's special monitoring mission for Ukraine said the situation in the war zone in the east of the country was becoming dire as temperatures turned freezing in the ex-Soviet state.
"Urgent steps needed as 600,000 people in the Lugansk region (are) at risk of being left without water, electricity and heating," Hug tweeted.
The rebel-run parts of Lugansk receive about a fifth of their water from Kiev-controlled portions of Ukraine and occasional humanitarian assistance from Russia.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) announced on October 5 that it would step in to pay Lugansk's debt to Ukraine on an emergency basis.
The official news agency of the Lugansk insurgents said parts of the region had stopped receiving water from the Kiev-controlled part of the splintered country on Thursday.
Kiev has also threatened to cut off the region's electricity if the Lugansk rebel authorities do not cover outstanding bills in the coming days.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said during a visit to Poland on Friday that "we note an absence of any progress about a roadmap" for peace in the separatist east.
"Facebook undeniably has great responsibility for its product and its platform.
It has a responsibility for all the fantastic things there, but also for the hate and lies being spread there," she said.
"I am convinced that they do n't want to be an arena for threats, hate and fake news ."
The debate about manufactured news circulating online and on social media came to a head during the US election campaign, but has had a wider impact – for example on Sweden, where fake reports were recently shared falsely claiming that Sweden had banned Christmas lights for religious reasons.
The minister spoke after Swedish comedian and commentator Jonas Gardell wrote an open letter to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, urging him to consider his own place in a so-called post-truth world, and suggesting appointing a publisher in each country to be legally accountable for the site.
"There are many who see that it has crossed the line, but we all want the process of change to be voluntary.

"However, the Latvian nation was able to overcome these and other, much more difficult challenges, and achieve excellent development.
There is a lot to learn from the economic development of Latvia at the beginning of the 1920s, especially taking into consideration that after World War I Latvia was in a far more complicated situation than, for instance, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, believes Vejonis.
The Commission of Historians of Latvia was established on November 13, 1998 at the initiative of then-President Guntis Ulmanis.

Dutch to seek EU nod for freeze on Turkey talks The Hague, Dec 2, 2016 (AFP) - The Dutch government will seek EU support to temporarily freeze accession talks with Turkey, Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Friday, in a move set to ratchet up tensions between Ankara and Brussels.
"We are going to see whether there's support in Europe... to suspend talks for half a year," Rutte said at his weekly press conference.
Turkey and the EU had agreed to speed up the long-stalled membership talks after both sides reached a deal in March to curb the flow of migrants into the European Union.
Rutte on Friday reiterated his Foreign Minister Bert Koenders' statement earlier this week, who said the accession talks were "comatose".
Koenders' comments come after Dutch lawmakers on Wednesday voted by majority for a temporary freeze of the talks, the public broadcaster NOS reported.
Erdogan on Tuesday said his country has not yet given up on its ambition to join the EU, but has "many other alternatives" if the stalled process goes nowhere.
After Britain's vote to leave the EU and Donald Trump's presidential triumph in the United States, Italy's establishment is viewed as next in line for a slap from the fed-up and the forgotten.
"It reduces the autonomy of local authorities and it concentrates too much power in the hands of the government without the necessary checks and balances," former prime minister Massimo D'Alema, a party colleague of Renzi's, told AFP. - 'Massive screw-you '- The stakes are high.
But if he wins, it will be a significant boost for the former mayor of Florence's broader reform agenda.
A No vote on the other hand could bolster the burgeoning popularity of Italy's populist and far-right opposition parties, already buoyed by Trump's success.
Beppe Grillo, leader of the populist Five Star Movement, hailed the US election result as a "massive screw you" from voters and urged Italians to follow suit on December 4.
"The bankers, the German government and a bunch of Brussels bureaucrats, that's who," he said.
And despite polls giving the No camp a lead of between five and eight percentage points, the outcome of Sunday's vote is far from certain.
Voter surveys are banned during the final two weeks of the campaign and those taken before the cut-off point all pointed to between a quarter and one third of voters being undecided.
In addition, the votes of up to a third of the four million Italians living abroad but registered to vote could swing things in Renzi's favour.
Early reports from embassies indicated strong postal voting among them -- while apathy could affect the turnout in the most disaffected parts of the homeland, notably the relatively impoverished south.
Football: Barca more desperate for El Clasico win - Luis Enrique Barcelona, Dec 2, 2016 (AFP) - Barcelona boss Luis Enrique accepted his side are by far the more in need of the three points when Real Madrid visit the Camp Nou on Saturday (1515GMT) in El Clasico. Madrid hold a six-point lead over Barca, who are off to their worst La Liga start in nine seasons, at the top of the table.
However, he insisted the Spanish champions remain the best team in the world when they hit top form.
"There are good teams at a high level, but none of them are better than us.
"Iniesta is our captain and a reference point for Barca's style," added Enrique.

In that sense we understand each other.
"Barca are the best team and when we play like we know how, we are unstoppable," the Turkish international told Barca TV.
"They have lost a very important player, but this season their reserves are playing very well.
Homeless California woman jailed for anti-Trump graffiti Los Angeles, Dec 1, 2016 (AFP) - A homeless California woman was sentenced to six months in jail on Thursday after admitting to tagging government buildings in downtown Los Angeles with expletive-filled graffiti against President-elect Donald Trump.

Europol: Islamic State planning new terror attacks in Europe The Hague (dpa) - The Islamic State extremist organization is planning fresh terrorist attacks in Europe in the near future, European law enforcement agency Europol warned in a report published in the Hague on Friday.
Defeats in Iraq and Syria and an increase in the number of returning fighters heightened the risk of attacks in western Europe, according to the report from Europol's Counter-Terrorism Centre.
The terror group were believed to be developing new tactics for attacks in the West and experts believed France was the mostly likely target, however Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain and Germany were also at risk.
Attacks could be carried out by networked groups or lone attackers using explosives, automatic weapons, knives, axes, machetes or cars.
Terrorism experts also believed the likelihood of car-bomb attacks was high.
Organisers claimed a turnout of 1.5 million for the candlelight rally in the South Korean capital, while police put the number at 220,000.
The 64-year-old stands accused of colluding with an old friend who has been formally indicted for attempted fraud and abuse of power.
While the protestors want her out immediately, the political establishment is struggling to find a similar unity of purpose.
In order to secure the two-thirds majority required for impeachment in the 300-seat national assembly, it will need the support of more than two-dozen lawmakers from Park's ruling Saenuri Party.
"I no longer believe a word the president or her party says," said bank employee Kim Hak-Won who was marching Saturday with his teenage daughter.
An adopted motion would still require approval of the Constitutional Court -- a process that could take up to six months.
The scandal that has engulfed Park and paralysed her administration has focused on her friendship with long-time confidante Choi Soon-Sil.
As president, Park can not be charged with a criminal offence except insurrection or treason, but she would lose that immunity once she steps down.

No solution for Aleppo without negotiations: EU, UN Rome, Dec 3, 2016 (AFP) - Top EU and UN diplomats warned on Saturday that there could be no victory in the battle for the Syrian city of Aleppo without negotiations aimed at ensuring a viable future for the war-torn country.
"You can win a war but you can lose the peace," said Federica Mogherini, the European Union's foreign affairs chief, at a conference on the Mediterranean region in Rome.
"Who is interested in winning a war in Syria and getting at a price a country that is divided, armed, full of terrorists... isolated in the international community ?"
UN envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura, who was also at the Rome conference, voiced concern about the Assad regime's advances in Aleppo.
"If this is going to be an occasion for the government to say: we won the war, and therefore no need for negotiations, I hope not," he said, adding that's why he counts on "the influence of Russia and Iran" to convince Damascus to seek a negotiated solution to the conflict.
More than 300,000 people have been killed since the Syrian conflict started with anti-government protests in March 2011, and over half the country's population has been displaced.
"We have already made solemn representations about it to the relevant US side.
It must be pointed out that there is only one China in the world.
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory," the statement said.
"We urge the relevant parties in the US to abide by the commitment to the one-China policy" and "to handle Taiwan-related issues with caution and care to avoid unnecessarily interfering with the overall situation of Sino-US relations," it said.
During Friday's discussion, Trump and Tsai noted "the close economic, political and security ties" between Taiwan and the US, according to the president-elect's office.
But since coming to office this year, Tsai has refused to accept the "One China" concept, prompting Beijing to cut off all official communication with the island's new government.

Russia substantially increases its misinformation attacks against the Baltics after U.S. presidential elections RIGA, Dec 4 (LETA) - After the recent presidential elections in the United States, Russia has substantially increases its misinformation attacks against the Baltics, according to the weekly Disinformation Review published by the EU's East StratCom Task Force.
The most strident claims were presented in Vremya Pokazhet, which stated for example that “the Baltic countries should show gratitude that they were allowed to leave the Soviet Union peacefully” (in fact both Lithuanians and Latvians were killed in the 1991 restoration of independence); and that "Russia gave the Baltic states the freedom they dreamed of” (ignoring the fact that the USSR had taken this freedom away in the first place).
In the talk show Mesto vstrech, it was said that Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are unable to protect their interests because of their bad economic policy - despite the evidence that the Baltic states are an example of successful transformation after 50 years of Soviet occupation, East StratCom Task Force informs.
In the same show, the Baltic countries were also accused of developing apartheid regimes to discriminate against Russian speakers, and that the Baltic states have never been independent anyway.
Similar anti-disinformation initiatives in the Czech Republic were also targeted by pro-Kremlin media.
In the table, you will find a detailed debunking showing the fundamental differences between the Western and pro-Kremlin outlets," East StratCom Task Force goes on to say in its weekly review.

Green candidate Van der Bellen received 53.3 per cent of the vote to Norbert Hofer's 46.7 per cent, according to a projection by public broadcaster ORF? based on 99.9 per cent of counted ballots.

"I congratulate Van der Bellen and the Austrian people for backing moderation and a united Europe,"? his Spanish counterpart Mariano Rajoy said.

Social Democratic Chancellor Christian Kern reached out to Hofer's supporters Sunday evening. "It's important that no-one feels like a loser on this day.
Hofer's voter "have perfectly legitimate worries"? that must be taken seriously, Van der Bellen said.

Recapture of Mosul'possible 'before next U.S. administration: Pentagon chief ABOARD A US MILITARY AIRCRAFT While the fight to retake the Iraqi city of Mosul from Islamic State is going to be difficult, it is "possible" it could be complete before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter said on Monday.
Some 100,000 Iraqi government troops, Kurdish security forces and mainly Shi'ite militiamen are participating in the assault on Mosul that began on Oct. 17, with air and ground support from a U.S.-led coalition.
"That is certainly possible and again it is going to be a tough fight," Carter said when asked if the recapture would be complete before Jan. 20, when Trump starts his presidency.
In a separate speech in California on Saturday, Carter left the door open for U.S. and coalition forces to stay in Iraq after Islamic State had been removed.
The committee endorsed the draft resolution which has yet to be approved by Saeima.
According to the law, the chief of defense is nominated by the Latvian president at the recommendation by the defense minister and appointed for a term of four years by the Latvian parliament.

Number of ferry passengers carried by Tallink on Riga-Stockholm line jumps 23 pct in November RIGA, Dec 5 (LETA) - Estonian ferry operator Tallink Grupp carried 34,695 passengers between Riga and Stockholm in November 2016, which was a 23 percent increase against the same month last year, the company said in a report to the Tallinn stock exchange.
The number of passengers carried by Tallink ferries between Finland and Sweden grew by 14.1 percent year-on-year to 201,411 people, and ferry passengers on the Estonia-Sweden route rose 0.8 percent to 66,318.

In his words, the Latvian-grown sea buckthorn is used primarily in juice production, but that recently an opportunity arose to export sea buckthor oil to the U.S. "We have started business also in the U.S. With our sea buckthor oil, we have made it to New Yor's posh restaurants," Bruvelis said, adding that the first two test shipments of sea buckthor oil were delivered to the U.S. only recently.
The business opportunity occurred as Bruvelis had been shipping sea buckthor plants to Canada for several years, and his Canadian business partner helped establish contacts with potential buyers in New York.
"This is a rather narrow, exclusive segment, so you can not call these large export volumes.
"If the restaurant's menu says that the sorbet or pudding has acquired its bright yellow color not from carrot-based color but from sea buckthor oil, it instantly raises the restaurant's prestige and the product's quality.
And clients are ready to pay for it, because we in Latvia produce 100 percent oil, which is cold-pressed and quite hard to find," Bruvelis said, adding that the price of such oil is EUR 150 per liter.
As a result, 2,500 jobs are lost in Latvia every year, the EUIPO told LETA.
Latvia is also ranked second according to the proportion of indirect losses caused by counterfeit clothing, footwear and accessories (22 percent of all sales) and counterfeit sports goods (16 percent).
Across the entire EU, 7.4 percent of sales are lost due to the presence of fakes on the market, and government revenue lost as a result of counterfeiting and piracy is estimated at EUR 14.3 billion.

"Years of misguided austerity, of increasing inequality, of insecurity have provided fertile ground for despair, and this is the result of years of neoliberal and conservative policies across Europe," the resolution says.
"Populists are taking advantage of this situation to spread their lies, hatred and division, as the results of the British referendum and the American elections have shown.
In many countries, the far right is now an ugly reality," the PES Council says in its resolution.
According to the PES resolution, the EU is under threat because people do not have fulfilling and secure jobs and because they do not believe that their children will have a better life than they have.
The resolution says neither basic economic freedoms nor competition rules can take precedence over fundamental social rights.
The PES Council considers migration "a continuous and natural phenomenon ." Unless the rule of law and human rights in Turkey are restored, the ongoing accession negotiations should be frozen, the resolution says.

US bows to pressure from native groups in denying pipeline permit Washington (dpa) - In a victory for thousands of protesters opposing an oil pipeline in North Dakota, the US government on Sunday denied a permit for continued construction of the multibillion-dollar project.
The Army Corps of Engineers denied the permit to the company behind the Dakota Access pipeline to drill under the Missouri River in the north-central US state.

Van der Bellen vows to be president for all Austrians THE LOCAL/AFP Alexander Van der Bellen, Austria’s president-elect, has said that he wants to be a president for all Austrians and promised to press the government on issues such as labour reform.
Austrian voters resoundingly rejected anti-immigration and eurosceptic Norbert Hofer's bid to become the European Union's first far-right president, a result greeted with relief from centrist politicians across the continent. Greens-backed independent candidate Van der Bellen swept 53.3 percent of Sunday's vote against 46.7 percent for his rival from the anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPÖ), according to public television projections.
"Today it is not an exaggeration if I say that today we see a red-white-red -- the flag of Austria -- as a signal of hope and change.
A red-white-red signal from Austria to all the capitals of the European Union," Van der Bellen, 72, said in Vienna.
The role of the Austrian president is largely ceremonial, but there had been fears that a Hofer victory would embolden other anti-establishment forces ahead of elections next year in France, Germany and the Netherlands.
The relief across Europe was palpable on Sunday evening, with German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier calling the outcome a "good omen against populism in Europe".
"I am very glad that we did not delay [the wage reform] any longer and that it will be fully implemented next year...
"It is clear that the State Police should be working not a repressive instrument but rather as a society-oriented police service," Kozlovskis said.
The workload of police is not going to decrease in the coming years as there are many challenges ahead, the minister said, adding that the steps that have been taken lately have been the "right steps".
State Police chief Ints Kuzis said that ensuring public order and security, as well as combating crime remain the the main objectives of the law enforcement agency.
"This year has shown that we have been fulfilling these tasks.
We see that public order and security have been ensured, the crime rate is stable with a slight tendency to drop," Kuzis said.

Greek court rejects extradition of 3 Turk officers accused of coup Athens, Dec 5, 2016 (AFP) - A Greek court on Monday rejected the extradition of three military officers demanded by Turkey over their alleged involvement in July's failed coup, a judicial source said.
The decision outraged Ankara, which has arrested tens of thousands of people as part of a wide-ranging crackdown since the attempted putsch.
"Greece is in the NATO alliance with Turkey and is a NATO ally.
Our expectation is that the Greek government make every effort to return" those individuals to Turkey, Defence Minister Fikri Isik said.
It also deemed that Turkish authorities have not provided sufficient evidence tying them to the coup attempt against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the source said.
The court is expected to decide the fate of the other five officers on Tuesday.
The two Turkish commanders, four captains and two sergeants requested asylum in Greece after landing a military helicopter in the northern city of Alexandroupoli shortly after the attempted government takeover in mid-July.

French town ordered to remove statue of Virgin Mary The Local A town in eastern France has been ordered to remove a statue of the Virgin Mary to comply with a national ban on religious symbols in public, the local mayor has said.
Town mayor Gaston Lacroix said he intended to find a new home for the offending statue "on private land".
The statue was subsequently sold to a religious cultural association which was not, however, allowed to buy the parcel of land it stood on, meaning it remained on public property and therefore in breach of French rules regarding religious symbols.
One of the world's most secular countries, France strongly separates religion and public life.

? Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was one of the first international leaders to react to the news Monday, saying that Key was "one of the most outstanding national leaders in the world today ."
Merkel's CDU to show'readiness to fight 'at party convention DW This week's CDU party convention will set the tone for Angela Merkel's campaign for a fourth term as German chancellor.
Together with their junior partners in the governing grand coalition, the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), the CDU can currently only expect between 54 and 58 percent support - leaving little margin for error at a time when voters throughout the West are increasingly turning to populist, anti-establishment options. It's no secret where the majority of the CDU's (and all the other major parties') lost voters have gone.
The CDU performed poorly in five regional elections this year and desperately needs to show better results in three further regional ones in 2017 before the national vote in September.
"In the confrontations to come, our political competitors will find out that the CDU is up for a fight," CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber said at party headquarters in Berlin ahead of the convention.
Tauber added that the current political situation entailed a battle over fundamental principles and compared it to the debates about deploying NATO nuclear missiles in West Germany in the early 1980s and the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification a decade later.
After having to tolerate some unaccustomed criticism from within conservative ranks after Germany accepted hundreds of thousands of refugees in 2015, Angela Merkel has shored up her position at the head of the CDU. On Tuesday, the party will confirm her as its chairwoman and thus its candidate for chancellor.
While not a full-fledged party platform, the document does generally set out the CDU's stances on issues including employment, digitalization, globalization, developmental aid, education, family issues, domestic security, defense, foreign policy and refugees.
Because it defines reducing the number of refugees as a goal and speaks of Germany having "a leading culture" into which all immigrants must integrate, the document has been interpreted as a return to the right in an attempt to win voters back from the anti-migrant AfD.
A stricter stance toward migrants would also help smooth over differences with the CDU's more conservative Bavarian sister party, the CSU, which has repeatedly called for an annual cap on the number of refugees in Germany.
"Populism, nationalist blinders, protectionism and deepening social divisions are not answers to the urgent problems of the present and the future," reads the fourth point in the position paper up for vote on Wednesday.
"The CDU is a party of values.
The visit continued cooperation launched with Kabul Polytechnic University in 2012 with an aim to promote the development of Afghanistan's railway industry.

Candidate chief of defense Kalnins does not back return to conscription; stresses role of family in teaching patriotism RIGA, Dec 5 (LETA) - Major General Leonids Kalnins, the candidate for Latvia's next chief of defense, does not support a return to conscription, for it can not serve as a school of patriotism and renewing compulsory military service would also require huge investments.
Kalnins argued against the idea to resume conscription, saying that it can not be used for teaching patriotism because it is the families that teach children to love their motherland.
It is also necessary to take into consideration technical and financial issues, as resuming compulsory military service would require huge resources, which automatically would have to be taken from the professional military.
As reported, President Raimonds Vejonis has decided to nominate Leonids Kalnins, Commander of the Joint Headquarters of the Latvian National Armed Forces, as the next chief of defense.
The defense cooperation agreement, which will be signed during Ravkov's visit to Riga, provides for cooperation between Latvia and Belarus in areas like international security and defense policies, airspace surveillance, arms control, activities planned in the framework of NATO's Partnership for Peace program, military medicine, as well as environmental protection, cultural and sports activities in the armed forces.
Belarus' defense minister is also scheduled to visit the Instructor School of the National Armed Forces in Cesis.
So far, Latvia and Belarus have had successful cooperation in arms control.
In 2004 the two neighbor countries concluded an agreement on additional confidence and security building measures in arms control.
Based on this agreement, the two countries organize additional visits of arms inspectors, experts' meetings, exchange of military information and observers visits to military training exercises.

Italy's Renzi loses referendum on constitutional reform: exit polls Rome, Dec 4, 2016 (AFP) - Italian voters on Sunday overwhelmingly rejected constitutional reform proposals on which Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has staked his political future, exit polls suggested.
The projected result was in line with what opinion polls had been indicating up until November 18, after which the media were banned from publishing survey results.
The defeat and Renzi's likely departure will plunge Italy in a new phase of political uncertainty and possible economic turmoil.
Presuming Renzi does step down, President Sergio Mattarella will be charged with brokering the appointment of a new government to run Italy until the next general election, which has to take place by the spring of 2018.

"This is the hardest decision I've ever made and I do n't know what I'll do next," he told a news conference, adding that he had never seen himself as a career politician.

Security Police ask to prosecute young Latvian for participation in Syria conflict RIGA, Dec 5 (LETA) - The Security Police last week asked the prosecutor's office of the Riga judicial district to prosecute a young Latvian who is suspected of unlawful participation in the Syria conflict.
The suspect is also implicated in joining an organization or group consisting of at least five people with the intention to commit especially grave crimes against humanity or peace, war crimes, genocide or especially grave crimes against the state.
In the summer, the Security Police obtained information that the Latvian citizen in question has been detained by Turkish authorities.
The Security Police would not disclose the suspect's name or even sex, but confirmed that three residents of Latvia are currently being probed for their unlawful participation in the armed conflict in Syria.
As reported, one of the persons accused of the above crime is Olegs Petrovs, the former leader of the Latvian Islamic Culture Center, who had been supporting terrorist attacks in France and extolling Jihad in his posts on the Internet.
According to unofficial information obtained by Latvian Television, the detained person is a young man named Martins. De Facto, an analytical news program of Latvian Television, reported last fall that Martins had joined Islamic militants in Syria.
Bob Dylan sends speech for Nobel ceremony Stockholm, Dec 5, 2016 (AFP) - Music icon Bob Dylan wo n't be at the Nobel prize ceremony this week to accept his award, but he has sent along a speech to be read aloud, the Nobel foundation said Monday.
"This year's Laureate in Literature, Bob Dylan, will not be participating in the Nobel Week but he has provided a speech which will be read at the banquet," the foundation said in a statement.
Rock legend Patti Smith will perform a version of Dylan's "A Hard Rain's A- Gon na Fall" at the ceremony on December 10 in Stockholm, which is the same day as the banquet.
Dylan said in a letter on November 16 that he would not attend the ceremony because he had "pre-existing commitments", in an announcement that did not come as a surprise to observers.
The Swedish Academy said it respected Dylan's decision, but that it was "unusual" for a Nobel laureate not to come to Stockholm to accept the award in person.
The left-wing candidate, who won 1 per cent of the vote nationally, has claimed that some voting machines used in states were vulnerable to hacking and could have been manipulated.
Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton had been expected to win to the three states but lost to Republican Donald Trump in the November 8 election. Flipping them from Trump to Clinton would swing enough electoral votes to change the outcome of the November 8 elections.
Trump officially won Michigan by 10,704 votes, or less than a quarter of a percentage point.
The recount had been scheduled to get under way on Wednesday after being delayed by earlier legal objections from Trump's team. But the judge agreed with Stein's lawyers who argued that the recount effort must get started immediately in order to ensure the vote deadline is met.
Presidential electors gather December 19 in each state to cast their ballots, which are sent to Congress in what is usually a formality.

The main transmission tower that showed Ukrainian television in the eastern conflict zone was destroyed by the insurgents in July 2014.
Many analysts in Kiev believe the rebels would get much less local support if people were not fed constant Kremlin propaganda that appears on Russian TV that they now receive.

"Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into their country (the US does n't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea ?"
he demanded, adding: "I do n't think so !"

"Winning this game was hard because Crotone were digging in, but we kept on fighting till the very end," said Milan coach Vincenzo Montella.
"That, for me, gave this win a special flavour ."

(w/ADD) Investment activity in Latvia remains low - FICIL Sentiment Index 2016 (expands) RIGA, Dec 5 (LETA) - Investment activity in Latvia remains low, according to FICIL Sentiment Index 2015-2016 "Development of the investment climate in Latvia: the viewpoints of foreign investors" presented by the Foreign Investors' Council in Latvia (FICIL) on Monday.
"But we can and we should focus on those factors that we can influence - reduce the internal barriers and inefficiencies, achieve real and tangible results on the much needed and long delayed structural reforms, ensure effective and transparent functioning of the court system and judiciary, create predictable and sustainable tax system," she said.
The second annual FICIL Sentiment Index shows that majority of foreign investors see only minor improvements in investment climate in Latvia over the past 12 months.
A service company, which was one of the investors participating in the survey, remarked rhetorically: "Why would someone want to invest here if new taxes are introduced without any consultations and your only possibility to look for justice is to go to court, like in the case of the solidarity tax?
At the same time, certain foreign investors noted positive changes, for example, Latvia's accession to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and others pointed out that, with so many problems and big risks in other parts of the world, Latvia looked slightly better than other places.
The foreign investors voiced similar opinions also about the availability of workforce, with most of them complaining that efforts to deal with this issue have been insufficient so far.
Foreign investors also criticized the work of the Latvian government on improving investment climate.
Some said the government was not interested in making real changes and did not have a real plan about how to tackle the problems.
The 2016 study suggests that there are major concerns with regard to the quality of the tax system.
Only five of the 32 interviewed respondents evaluated the quality of the Latvian tax system as either good or experiencing some positive change compared to the previous year.
Only three of the surveyed 32 investors gave a positive or neutral answer when asked about uncertainty of the situation in Latvia.

Grillo called for immediate elections and said that from next week the party would begin putting together a policy platform and a cabinet team so that Italians would have all the information they needed to put the party into power.
5-Star is running neck-and-neck with Renzi's Democratic Party, according to opinion polls, and would be a clear favorite to win a national election under the two-round electoral system pushed through by Renzi last year.
"The biggest loser in the referendum is the propaganda and lies of the regime," Grillo said. "The biggest winners are the people who lifted up their heads and turned out en masse to vote ."
One of the party's leading lights, Alessandro Di Battista, a 38-year-old deputy widely expected to be foreign minister if 5-Star wins power, spent the summer traveling around Italy on a scooter campaigning to muster support against the reform.
At a 5-Star news conference after the referendum, Di Battista said it was time for opponents and commentators to stop branding the party as populist and "anti-political" and to treat it as a future party of government.
Luigi Di Maio, 30, expected to be the party's candidate for prime minister, listed its flagship proposals for basic income support for the poor, a referendum on the euro, tax cuts for small companies and a public bank to fund investments.

During his time on campus, Ilves said he plans to delve deeply into the intersections between information technology and security policy, areas that have long fascinated him during his career.
"Stanford has long been a place I enjoy visiting as one of the few if only universities to have top minds from both realms," Ilves wrote in an email interview, noting how many Stanford scholars are studying these types of issues. He has some big projects in mind.
Ilves added, "Much of what we have seen in the past decade – massive hacks, data theft, privacy violations – come from fundamental weaknesses in the haphazard way our digital world has developed, where security is primarily an afterthought and a patch ."
Parallel to this topic, Ilves said his most recent speeches and articles have examined the "challenges of an increasingly fissiparous and nationalist Europe ." Ilves believes the challenge for all small European countries, Estonia included, is to maintain a functioning European Union as well as a strong NATO, the primary treaty basis of trans-Atlantic relations.
"With elections across Europe increasingly demonstrating a turn toward nationalism and populism, the EU and NATO currently face their greatest challenge since their founding.
As a small country that has consistently supported the EU and NATO as a matter of national security, for Estonia, this is a question of national survival," said Ilves.
For each euro Latvia pays into EU budget, it gets on average four euros back - Finance Ministry RIGA, Dec 6 (LETA) - Latvia will receive more from the European Union budget next year than its pays in, Finance Ministry spokesman Aleksis Jarockis informed LETA.
Jarockis said that it is impossible to calculate the exact sum Latvia will receive from the EU budget in 2017, and that it could be similar to what Latvia received in 2015.
In 2015, Latvia received EU co-financing worth EUR 981.6 million, or approximately 0.8 percent of the EU's total budget expenditure which is paid out to member states.
Data for 2016 is still being calculated.

The victim was found dead on a river bank on October 16th.

Corruption Prevention Bureau to look into media reports about insolvent persons donating money to Harmony RIGA, Dec 6 (LETA) - The Corruption Prevention Bureau will look into media reports that Harmony and a few organizations associated with the party last year received donations from insolvent persons, whose donations exceeded their actual incomes.
TV3 recently reported that three insolvent persons had donated money to Harmony, the Young.lv organization - which has the same official address as the head office of Harmony, and where Riga Mayor Nils Usakovs' (Harmony) former wife Jelena Usakova is a member of the board, and organization 9maijs.lv that organizes the May 9 celebrations in Riga every year.
Arturs Pravs, Harmony's coordinator in Riga who was ruled insolvent at the end of 2015, last year paid Harmony EUR 5,000 in his membership fees and also donated EUR 2,000 to Young.lv.
Last year Pravs worked at the KTE sewerage company where, judging from the company's annual report, his monthly salary did not exceed EUR 1,000.
Harmony activist Julija Malika-Grundane has been insolvent since November 2012.
According to court documents, her monthly salary is EUR 715, from which she has to spend EUR 230 every month to pay her debts.
Likewise, Maksims Tolstojs, chairman of Harmony's group at the Riga City Council, was ruled insolvent in November 2014.
If they can not do this, their donations are considered illegal and the party that received a given donation has to transfer the amount to the state budget.
Harmony received EUR 76,000 in donations and EUR 27,000 in membership fees last year.
S. Korea president's impeachment looks certain Seoul, Dec 6, 2016 (AFP) - The impeachment of South Korea's scandal-hit president, Park Geun-Hye, looked certain Tuesday as dissident lawmakers in her ruling party said they would support an opposition motion calling for her ouster.
The national assembly is slated to vote on the impeachment motion on Friday, with the backing of around 30 Saenuri Party MPs needed to reach the required two-thirds majority.
The ruling party had initially insisted that Park be allowed to step down voluntarily, and had proposed a timeline that would see her resign in April -- 10 months short of her full presidential term.
"Following rounds of discussion, we've concluded that the card of the president leaving her office in April has already been rejected by the people," said a member of the faction, lawmaker Hwang Young-Cheul.
According to Hwang's count, around 35 Saenuri Party MPs would support the motion which, if adopted, would still require approval by the Constitutional Court -- a process that could take up to six months.

The Kremlin's new "information security doctrine" comes as attention has focused on the rise in state-sponsored hacking after the US blamed Moscow for cyberattacks aimed at influencing last month's presidential election.
The document -- an update of the country's last policy from 2000 -- details a raft of threats that the Kremlin is worried about, from foreign hacking and negative media coverage abroad to the "erosion of traditional Russian spiritual and moral values".
The vague plan offers few concrete steps but does set out the general aims of the new policy including bolstering the military's propaganda output and ratcheting up controls over the internet in Russia.

Venezuela also voted against the text, while Angola abstained.
The 11 other member nations on the council cast their votes for the text.
The vote marked the sixth time that Russia blocked a council resolution on Syria since the conflict began in March 2011, and the fifth time that China did so.
In an eleventh-hour effort, Russia tried to postpone the vote until at least Tuesday, when a meeting was set to take place in Geneva between the Americans and the Russians.
But Paris, London and Washington -- the main backers of the text -- decided to go ahead anyway.
But the rebels have rejected the plan.

Tackling the hot potato issue head-on, Merkel vowed that "a situation like that of summer 2015 can and must not repeat itself ."
She also stressed that each asylum request would be examined carefully, and "not all can and will stay" in Germany.

Last summer, he waded into the debate on the Islamic "burkini", declaring the full-body swimsuit "not compatible" with French values.

Kirsis, a member of the Home Guard Student Battalion, says that combining service in the Home Guard and work at Saeima is not hard at all: "That's just one weekend a month, plus a nine-day camp during the summer.
And the system is quite flexible.
Janis Upenieks (Unity), a former Youth Guard and Scout Movement member, who once even considered joining the Special Tasks Unit, also said he did not have enough time at the moment.
On the other hand, Viktors Valainis (Unity) said he was considering joining the Home Guard sometime in the future.
Ainars Latkovskis (Unity), chairman of Saeima Defense, Internal Affairs and Corruption Prevention Committee, explained that it would not be right for him, an official supervising the defense sector, to also be a member of the Home Guard.

Russia using period of uncertainty post-U.S. elections to spread misinformation about Baltics - experts RIGA, Dec 6 (LETA) - Russia is using the current period of uncertainty in the post-U.S. elections period to its advantage to spread misinformation about Europe and the Baltics, several researchers and experts have told LETA.
The director of the Latvian Institute of International Affairs - Andris Spruds, said that he has had offers from two Russian television programs to participate in discussions about the Baltics in just the past three days.
Up until now, there were only two main subjects discussed on Russian television - Ukraine and Syria.
Does this automatically mean that the subject will be developed?
This can not be ruled out," said Spruds, adding that these messages are being focused mostly on Russian residents.
The director of the Latvian Institute of International Affairs added that the increase in interest by Russia does not mean that the Baltics should become worried, but added that it can not be ruled out that this increase in interest could be due to recent events taking place in Europe, as well as the presence of the United States and NATO in the region.
This situation is a bit concerning, however, we must continue to monitor how often this will take place," he said.
He said that these attempts by Russia will fail if the residents of the Baltics do not become overly concerned and become more confident in themselves.
''We must not exaggerate what is happening, but remember that something deliberate is taking place here," he said.
Center for East European Policy Studies expert Maris Cepuritis had a similar opinion, pointing out that this is a period of uncertainty after the conclusion of the U.S. presidential elections.
''It is possible this misinformation campaign will last until next January, when Trump finally takes office and his policies will be more clear," he said, adding that Russia has carried out similar misinformation campaigns against the Baltics in the past.
As reported, after the recent presidential elections in the United States, Russia has substantially increases its misinformation attacks against the Baltics, according to the weekly Disinformation Review published by the EU's East StratCom Task Force.

Redgrave said her parents took her and her brother from London to stay with a cousin in the countryside during the Second World War, when they also tried to secure visas for Jews fleeing Nazi occupied territories.
Her first experience of helping refugees was after the crushing of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 when many fled to London.
"I was in drama school.
As a volunteer she said she "made tea, tried to cook, held hands, listened" to the Hungarian refugees living in squalid homes in Ladbroke Grove in west London.
Her new film, which also features actors Emma Thompson and Ralph Fiennes, recounts life for refugees in Europe over the last century and draws parallels between harsh government attitudes towards refugees in Britain in the 1930s and now.
The film also hinges on the importance of the post-war Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Redgrave remembers hearing in 1948 for the first time.
"I felt a great sense of relief as a child because I thought countries have found a way to stop anything like the Holocaust and the Second World War happening again.
"I still remain of that childish view," she said.
"The shameful thing is that our government, my government, has done everything possible to prevent child refugees from having access to their actual legal rights under international protection law," she said.
"The international press seem to have invented a hostility to refugees... People in Britain are very willing to help," she said, although admitting that people can become tired of helping.
Redgrave filmed "Sea Sorrow" in several countries including France, Greece, Italy and Lebanon, beginning the project after an image of a Syrian boy washed up on a Turkish beach went viral.
Nearly 12,000 people have died or gone missing crossing the Mediterranean Sea since the start of 2014, according to figures from the UN refugee agency.

Government should do more to support Latvians living in Ireland - ambassador RIGA, Dec 7 (LETA) - While tackling remigration matters, the government should also do more to support Latvians who live in Ireland, as Latvian Ambassador to Ireland Gints Apals said at a meeting of Saeima Citizenship, Migration and Social Cohesion Committee today. There are around 30,000 to 35,000 residents of Latvia living in Ireland.
Each year, about 1,000 Latvians arrive in Ireland, but it there are no precise data on how many Latvians leave Ireland or return to Latvia.
Approximately 6,000 Latvians who live in Ireland are children under 18, and more than 2,000 are 20 to 30 years old, said Apals.
The government has to work on developing sustainable relations with the Latvian diaspora in Ireland, and do more to support it, believes the ambassador.
So far Latvia has been focusing on remigration, however, taking into consideration that the demand for labor in Latvia is not as high as anticipated a few years ago, and that Latvians abroad contribute around EUR 100 million a year to the Latvian economy, the government should also pay attention to stabilization and development of sustainable relations with Latvians living abroad.
It is also important the results of high school exams that Latvian children in Ireland take in the Latvian language be recognized in Latvia.

"The current suspension mechanism is not adequate and will now be improved," following the deal, said Kalinak, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency.

China should build more nuclear arms to prepare for Trump: media Beijing, Dec 8, 2016 (AFP) - China should "significantly" increase military spending and build more nuclear weapons as a response to US President-elect Donald Trump, an editorial in the nationalistic Global Times newspaper said Thursday.
China should "build more strategic nuclear arms and accelerate the deployment of the DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missile" to protect its interests, should Trump attempt to corner the country in an "unacceptable way", it said.
"China's military spending in 2017 should be augmented significantly," it added in the print article run in both English and Chinese.
The paper is not part of the official state media, but has close ties to the ruling Communist Party.
In the editorial, the Global Times said: "We need to get better prepared militarily regarding the Taiwan question to ensure that those who advocate Taiwan's independence will be punished, and take precautions in case of US provocations in the South China Sea ."
Nevertheless, the state-owned China Daily newspaper remained pessimistic about the future of relations with the US.

On the lighter side at number three was the runaway success of Pokemon Go, the location-based augmented reality game for smartphone users. Other subject matters shared among Facebook's 1.79 billion users were more sober, with the fourth leading topic the "Black Lives Matter" movement, followed by the election in the Philippines of Rodrigo Duterte.
Number six on the list was the Olympic games, followed by Brexit, the Super Bowl and the deaths of rock star David Bowie and boxing icon Muhammad Ali.
The video has been viewed more than 160 million times.
Also, manufacturing industry has demonstrated excellent export results, proving that these companies are able and ready to work in the global market, offiering interesting products, and there is the information and communication technologies sector that is creating competitive services in cooperation with other sectors.
The minister said that Latvia is in a complicated situation - in a trap of medium-level income, and low workforce is no more the main criterion for investments.
In a long term, those companies will gain who will generate new ideas and go into international markets, using state support in different forms.
"Latvian companies are everywhere - in China, the United Arab Emirates, Belarus, Ukraine and other countries.
These companies are able to generate new ideas that are the basis of the new economy," the minister said.
Government lacks clear-cut arguments why investments should be made in Latvia - expert RIGA, Dec 8 (LETA) - Investors are interested in investing in the Baltic states, but Latvia does not offer officially defined arguments why investments should be made in Latvia, said Klavins Ellex lawyers office's partner Raimonds Saidins in an interview with LETA.
Klavins Ellex cooperates with large lawyers offices that are not represented in the Baltic region but whose customers are interested in investments in the Baltics.
Latvia has relaitvely good infrastructure and well-educated workforce.
"When sitting at one table with the Estonian and Lithuanian representatives, at one moment there is nothing more to say, especially when Estonians start speaking about transparency of their state administration, the education system and low corruption," the expert said.
Analyzing reasons for the drop of investments, Slaidins said that investors are sensitive to risks.
The past years have been full of challenges - occupation of Crimea, Ukraine's problems, Brexit in Europe, also the recent US presidential elections have left an impact.
"Investors are communicating among themselves, exchanging experience, sharing their stories about how difficult it is to achieve results in Latvia," said Slaidins. He also said that predictability in legislation is another important factor.
Investors are planning their activities, and it is good if they know what can be expected in the coming five years or so.
"There is a lack of predictability in Latvia due to the frequent government changes or other reasons," said Slaidins.
The highest percentages were observed also in Romania (24.4 percent), Lithuania (24 percent) and Poland (23.6 percent), followed by Estonia (22.8 percent), Germany (22.5 percent), Ireland (21.6 percent), and the United Kingdom (21.3 percent).
In contrast, less than 10 percent of employees were low wage earners in Sweden (2.6 percent), Belgium (3.8 percent), Finland (5.3 percent), Denmark (8.6 percent), France (8.8 percent) and Italy (9.4 percent).
There are large differences between genders and age groups regarding the proportion of low-wage earners.
The level of education also plays an important role: the lower the level, the higher is the likelihood of being a low-wage earner.
In the EU in 2014, while 28.2 percent of employees with a low education level were low-wage earners, the proportion decreased to 20.9 percent for those with a medium education level and to less than 7 percent for employees with a high education level.
Across member states, the highest national median gross hourly earning was five times higher than the lowest when expressed in Purchasing Power Standards (PPS), which eliminates price level differences between countries.
As measured in October 2014, the highest median gross hourly earnings in PPS were recorded in Denmark (18.5 PPS) and Ireland (18.4 PPS), ahead of Belgium (15.4 PPS), Germany and Luxembourg (both 15.0 PPS), the Netherlands and Sweden (both 14.5 PPS).
The highest median gross hourly earning in euro was recorded in Denmark (EUR 25.5), ahead of Ireland (EUR 20.2), Sweden (EUR 18.5), Luxembourg (EUR 18.4), Belgium (EUR 17.3) and Finland (EUR 17.2).

The bureau pointed out that, on the one hand, this would not change anything as insolvency administrators would still have the status according to the Law on Prevention of Conflict of Interest in Activities of Public Officials.

Nordea expects Latvia's economic growth to reach 1.6% this year and 2.8% in 2017 RIGA, Dec 8 (LETA) - Nordea bank estimates Latvia's economic growth to reach 1.6 percent this year, 2.8 percent in 2017 and 2.6 percent in 2018.

Tariq, his wife and seven children left Latvia two months ago as they were unable to make ends meet.
The family saw Germany as their last hope, however, Tariq returned to Latvia earlier this week as he was denied a work permit in Germany and could not apply for benefits.
The fact that Tariq's sister, also a refugee, lives in Germany was of no help.

Tariq believes that all the refugees who have left Latvia will soon have to come back, or they will have to work illegally in Germany - if they are caught, they will be deported to Latvia anyway.
There are more than 60 refugees from Latvia in Germany, and none of them may work there, said Tariq.
"We can not expect that private individuals and organizations will carry all this burden," said the association's activist Ieva Raubisko, adding that the state should not try to avoid responsibility, and that her association alone will not be able to provide all support that refugees need.
When refugees from Latvia went to Germany, they were not stripped of their benefits, and Tariq continues to receive his EUR 138 a month.
However, this is not enough.
As reported, so far Latvia has received a total of 154 persons under the EU refugee relocation program, of which ten persons have been granted the status of a refugee and 53 persons have been granted the status of alternative protection.

Chinese media warn'immature 'Trump over Taiwan policy Beijing, Dec 12, 2016 (AFP) - Chinese media warned Donald Trump Monday that the one-China policy is "non-negotiable" and dropping it could lead to Beijing supporting US enemies, after the president-elect said he might do so unless Beijing made concessions.
"The one-China policy can not be traded," an unsigned online commentary in the nationalistic Global Times said Monday, calling Trump "as ignorant of diplomacy as a child".
It warned that if the US openly supports Taiwan's independence and ramps up arms sales to the democratically self-ruled island, China could aid "forces hostile to the US".
"Why could n't we publicly support them, or secretly sell arms to them ?"
But this time it warned that if Trump "openly abandons the one-China policy, there will be a real storm.
At that point, what need does mainland China have for prioritising peaceful unification with Taiwan over retaking the island by military force ?"
The English-language edition of the Global Times quoted a Chinese scholar calling Trump a "novice" in diplomacy with a "very superficial" understanding of Taiwan and Sino-US relations.

In a second report published Friday, independent World Anti-Doping Agency investigator Richard McLaren said that more than 1,000 Russian athletes had been implicated in connection with systematic and state-organized doping practices in the country.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has announced retests of all Russian samples from their 2014 home Winter Olympics in Sochi.
EU agrees money-for-migration deal with Mali BRUSSELS The European Union, under an agreement published on Monday, will provide funds to Mali to help it create jobs and strengthen border management in return for the African country's aid in fighting people smugglers and accepting deportees from Europe.
The Mali agreement comes as they EU is stepping up migration collaboration with countries of origin and transit in Africa and the Middle East to prevent a repeat of last year's uncontrolled influx of refugees and migrants to its shores.
Announced by the Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders after his talks in Bamako, the deal also envisages EU support to Mali on development, biometric passports and advancing security in northern part of the West African country.
The arrival of 1.4 million people to the EU this year and last - many of them crossing by boat from North African countries on the shores of the Mediterranean - has triggered political infighting between members and the bloc has increasingly made curbing immigration a priority.
Beijing'seriously concerned 'by Trump's One China remarks: govt Beijing, Dec 12, 2016 (AFP) - Beijing is "seriously concerned" by US president-elect Donald Trump's suggestion that he could drop Washington's One China policy unless the mainland makes concessions on trade and other issues, it said Monday.
If the One China principle, which guides relations with self-ruling Taiwan, is "compromised or disrupted, the sound and steady growth of China-US relations as well as bilateral cooperation in major fields would be out of the question", foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular briefing.
Beijing considers Taiwan a "core interest" that affects China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, he said, adding that adherence to the One China policy was the "political bedrock" for relations with the US.
The comments came in response to Trump's remarks in an interview Sunday that he did not see why Washington must "be bound by a One China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade".
Those brought into custody include municipal level officials and regional leaders.
The HDP? has condemned Saturday's attack, which left 44 people dead - including 36 police officers - and which was claimed by a hardline Kurdish militia, the shadowy Kurdistan? Freedom? Falcons (TAK).

More than 1,000 party members in total have been arrested in the past year.
No call for EU sanctions against Russia on Syria: Mogherini Brussels, Dec 12, 2016 (AFP) - The EU has no plans to impose sanctions on Russia over the conflict in Syria, foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said on Monday ahead of a leaders' summit this week.
"No, we did n't discuss at all sanctions, and there was no member state asking for additional work on sanctions" against Russia, Mogherini said after a meeting of European Union foreign ministers.
But with Russian-backed Syrian forces on the verge of retaking the few remaining parts of Aleppo still in rebel hands, the EU warned at the weekend it could add to a long list of figures and groups in Syria it has already hit with travel bans and asset freezes.
There had been hints that EU leaders could also act against Russia when they meet on Thursday, especially after the resignation last week of Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, one of the biggest opponents of sanctions.
Football: Cavani double saves PSG against Nice Paris, Dec 11, 2016 (AFP) - A second-half brace from Edinson Cavani saw champions Paris Saint Germain come from two down to earn a 2-2 draw with Ligue 1 leaders Nice at the Parc des Princes on Sunday.
Nice coach Lucien Favre looked relieved with the point after Cavani had finished from close range on 46 minutes and then on the hour mark before the champions ripped into the Ligue 1 leaders all the way to the final whistle.
"We really suffered out there, they imposed a terrible rhythm early on and it was difficult for us, but then came that extraordinary goal," Favre said after the game.
Hatem Ben Arfa, who switched to PSG from Nice in the summer, also made a late cameo.
"That match taught us something we did n't know about ourselves.
It keeps us top and we can do even better," the striker said.
"We have long supported the principle of congressional review of this matter," said White House spokesman Josh Earnest, saying one was "certainly warranted ."
Dismissing President-elect Donald Trump's doubts about Moscow's role, Earnest added: "You did n't need a security clearance to figure out who benefited from malicious Russian cyber activity ." arb/sst

Part of an anti-terror probe, the sweeping arrest operation came after weekend attacks killed 38 people in Istanbul, mostly police, which were claimed by the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK), seen as a radical offshoot of the PKK.
The other detentions took place in the southern provinces of Adana and Mersin, Manisa in western Turkey as well as Sanliurfa in the country's restive southeast.

"We have no comment on the matter,"? Taiwan presidential spokesman Alex Huang said.
On Sunday, Trump said in an interview with US broadcaster Fox News that he understood the US policy of recognizing just one China and not dealing separately with states like Taiwan.
"But I do n't know why we have to be bound by a One-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade," he said.

"Syrian regime forces are now in control of 90 percent" of the one-time rebel areas in Aleppo's east, he said.
Latvia skeleton team to boycott world championships in Russia RIGA, Dec 12 (LETA) - The Latvian skeleton team will boycott the World Championships in Sochi next February, as the team announced on Sunday.
"Enough time has passed since first public WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) and IOC (International Olympic Committee) announcements regarding dirty athletes in our sport.

"While our international federation is still going to "read and digest the report", we will do what we can - we will be glad to race in World Championships at any track of the world, but we are not participating in World Championships in Sochi, Russia - a place where Olympic spirit was stolen in 2014," reads the statement.
Incoming UN chief Guterres says'UN must be ready to change' United Nations, United States, Dec 12, 2016 (AFP) - Incoming UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres vowed Monday to improve the world body's ability to respond to global crises after taking the oath of office.
In a reference to Trump's shock election victory and the surge in populism worldwide, Guterres said "fear is driving the decisions of many people around the world ."
Citizens worldwide are losing confidence in their governments and in global institutions, he said, adding that it was "time to reconstruct relations" between leaders and their people.
Guterres laid out three priorities for change during his five-year term: work for peace, supporting sustainable development and internal reforms.
"The battle of Aleppo has reached its end.
It is just a matter of a small period of time, no more, no less... it's a total collapse," said Rami Abdel Rahman, director of the Britain-based monitor.
Finance Ministry proposes transferring 70.4% of microenterprise tax revenue into social insurance contributions account starting 2017 RIGA, Dec 12 (LETA) - The Finance Ministry has prepared amendments to the Microenterprise Tax Law, which stipulate setting the microenterprise tax rate at 15 percent and, starting 2017, transferring 70.4 percent of revenue from microenterprise tax into the state social insurance contributions account, as the Finance Ministry informed LETA.
Taking into account that the Microenterprise Tax will be replaced by a new regulation on small enterprises, it would make little sense to make the microenterprise tax system overly complicated, and calculating the amount of the tax on the basis of companies' turnover is the simplest option, explains the Finance Ministry. The amendments also offer a proportionate transitory period so all microenterprises could choose the best tax regime for them until January 15, 2017.
The bill stipulates that microenterprise tax payers who by December 15 this year apply for termination of their microenterprise status will be able to renew this status by repeatedly applying for the status at the State Revenue Service until January 15 next year.
The case also threatens the credibility of the International Monetary Fund, as Lagarde is the third IMF chief to face trial.
The IMF has given its full backing to Lagarde, who was named to a second term in February this year, over the case.
Lagarde, upon becoming finance minister in 2007 under the newly elected president Nicolas Sarkozy, ordered that Tapie's long-running battle with the state be resolved by arbitration.
The decision was hugely costly, with Tapie initially walking away with a staggering 404 million euros ($427 million) in compensation in 2008. After a lengthy court battle, he has since been ordered to repay the money.
The prosecution says that through her actions, Lagarde "deprived the state of a chance to avoid this money being misused".
The suspects, operating in multiple cars, surrounded the armored truck and forced it off the A6 highway between Paris and Lyon, a national gendarme service spokesman and a judicial official said.
They then seized the gold, locked the two delivery men in the back of the truck, and set one of their own cars on fire before fleeing, according to the spokesman.
He said the flames spread to three cars nearby and were threatening to engulf the armored truck as well, but local police intervened thanks to a tipoff from a witness and rescued the two men in time.
The company said in a statement that the cargo was destined for industrial use.
Cologne ramps up New Year's police presence after sex assaults Cologne, Germany, Dec 12, 2016 (AFP) - The German city of Cologne Monday announced a ramped-up police presence, more CCTV and a fireworks-free zone at upcoming New Year's Eve celebrations to avoid a repeat of last year's mass sexual assaults.
Cologne police chief Juergen Mathies said 1,500 officers would be deployed on the streets of the western city this year, up from some 140 last year, when police came under fire for failing to properly respond to the chaotic events.
Much of the increased security will focus on the square between the city's iconic Dom cathedral and the train station where most of the assaults took place.
Cologne mayor Henriette Reker said access to the square this year would be tightly controlled, with no firecrackers or other pyrotechnics allowed in the safety zone.
The square will also be flooded with light as part of a video and light installation by German artist Philipp Geist that will be projected onto the Dom.
The majority of the perpetrators were never caught.
Of the suspects who were identified, many were migrants from Morocco and Algeria.
Third attempt to form Iceland government fails Reykjavik (dpa) - A third attempt to form a new government in Iceland failed Monday as the leader of the anti-establishment Pirate Party handed back the mandate to the president. Birgitta Jonsdottir of the Pirate Party said the result was disappointing.
"But if people are not ready to go a long way out of their comfort zone you ca n't push them to join a coalition," she said.
The Pirate Party had aimed to form a five-party coalition with Bright Future, the Social Democrats, the Reconstruction Party and the Left-Green Movement.
Jakobsdottir said she does not exclude a minority coalition.
The equation is complicated by the fact that several parties have ruled out working together.
The president initially approached Bjarni Benediktsson of the conservative Independence Party, which was part of the ousted centre-right coalition. Benediktsson's party won 21 seats, making it the largest in the legislature.
Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz said on Monday that the EU “must at least freeze the accession negotiations”, adding that “it is wrong to continue accession negotiations as if nothing negative has happened in Turkey in the last few months”.
Slovakian Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak admitted that discussions with Turkey “would not be easy” but said that Turkey is an important partner for the EU.
EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has also spoken in favour of negotiations continuing, saying that for the sake of the Turkish people their country should not be shut out.
On Thursday, EU leaders will discuss the bloc’s deal with Turkey to stop tens of thousands of migrants arriving in Europe. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to open border gates after the European Parliament called last month for a freeze on membership talks.
The 27 leaders meeting without British Prime Minister Theresa May at dinner on Thursday will issue a statement setting out key principles of the negotiations, one source told AFP on condition of anonymity.
The leaders will say they are "ready to negotiate" as soon as May triggers Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which sets a two-year clock running until Britain's exit from the bloc, the source quoted the text as saying, which is still in draft form.
The 27 states will agree that they should then "adopt the negotiating lines" that will govern the talks with Britain -- something neither side has set out in detail yet, the source said.
They will also reaffirm their commitment to their statement immediately after Britain's shock referendum vote to leave, in which they said Britain could not expect access to the EU's single market without keeping freedom of movement for EU citizens.
Finally, the EU leaders will seek a "decision authorising the opening of negotiations as quickly as possible" after setting out their negotiating lines, the source said.
Barnier warned Britain last week that it had only about 18 months for negotiations that should be wrapped up by October 2018, in time for the European and British parliaments to approve the deal by March 2019.
Le Drian said that under the new approach a cyberattack could constitute an act of war, which would require an appropriate response from a new specialised unit known as Cybercom.
If hackers were identified as coming from a country that had failed to stop them, "the responsibility of this state could be called into question," he said.
"Our offensive cyber-capabilities must allow us to breach the systems and networks of our enemies to cause damage, service suspensions or temporary or definitive neutralisations," he added.
The French unit will begin work next month and a team of up to 2,600 specialists will be created by 2019, Le Drian said.
As well as attacks on infrastructure or sensitive government computer networks, intelligence agencies are increasingly worried about the ability of hackers to spread propaganda or misinformation.
American media reported last weekend that the CIA had concluded that Russia sought to influence the US election in favour of Donald Trump by hacking the Democratic National Committee's emails.
The allegations of Russian involvement were denied by Moscow, Trump's camp and by WikiLeaks, which leaked embarrassing emails related to Trump's Democrat challenger Hillary Clinton during the campaign.
Within a couple of hours officers were able to calm residents of the centre, while a number of people were detained.
The reason for the fight was not clear.
On Sunday afternoon fighting between different nationalities began again after backup had been sought from other refugee centres, the statement said.
One person was badly injured in the final brawl and taken to hospital, while four occupants were arrested.

11 arrested in France over Nice massacre Nice, France, Dec 12, 2016 (AFP) - French police on Monday arrested 11 people suspected of helping to arm the Islamist radical who crushed 86 people to death with a truck in Nice, sources close to the investigation said.
Ten suspects, including one or more Albanians, were arrested in various parts of Nice and another was detained in the western city of Nantes, the sources said.
"They (the 11) did not necessarily know about the attack but they are part of a criminal milieu involved in arms smuggling," a source said, adding that the person arrested in Nantes had previously lived in Nice.
Six people have been charged so far over alleged links to the 31-year-old killer but investigators have yet to prove that any of them knew what he was planning.
Investigators said he suffered from depression and appeared to have become radicalised very quickly.

Teachers' minimum monthly salary could be raised to EUR 900 by 2022 RIGA, Dec 12 (LETA) - By 2022, teachers' minimum monthly salary is to be increased to EUR 900, according to a draft schedule for increasing teachers' salaries obtained by LETA.
The minimum salary for teachers will be increased gradually, starting September 1, 2018 when teachers' minimum salary for standard workweek, which currently stands at EUR 680, will be raised to EUR 710.
The minimum salary will then be increased EUR 70 to EUR 900 on September 1, 2022.

The announcement came as the government of Venezuela -- a country in the midst of an economic crisis and crippled with the world's highest inflation -- prepares to issue new banknotes and coins in values up to 200 times the highest denomination currently available.
Jose Guerra, a former director of Venezuela's central bank and now an opposition lawmaker, said on Twitter that to switch out 100 bolivar notes in such a short amount of time, the central bank "must have an equivalent amount in notes of greater denominations," which he did not believe was possible.
Falling prices for Venezuela's crucial oil exports have caused a shortage of dollars in the country, driving up prices of imports of food, medicine and other crucial goods.
Death toll in Istanbul attack rises to 44, including eight civilians Istanbul (dpa) - The death toll in the weekend Istanbul attack near a football stadium has risen to 44 people - 36 police officers and eight civilians - Health? Minister Recep Akdag said on Monday, the state-run? Anadolu news agency reported.
The Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK), a shadowy hardline Kurdish militia, claimed the attack, saying two of its members died carrying out the bombings.
The group said the blasts were in response to the government's military actions in the mostly Kurdish south-east of the country.
Macedonian opposition also claims election victory Skopje, Dec 11, 2016 (AFP) - The Macedonian opposition Social Democrats claimed victory in elections on Sunday, shortly after the ruling conservative party had announced that it had won.

Serbia to open first trial for Srebrenica massacre Belgrade, Dec 12, 2016 (AFP) - Serbia on Monday will take the unprecedented step of trying eight men for taking part in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, Europe's worst atrocity since World War II.
It is the first time Serbia will try suspects involved in the Srebrenica massacre.
"This is a very important case as Serbia needs to face its past," Serbia's former war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic told AFP.
"Without that there can be no catharsis, no reconciliation in the region ."
The Srebrenica massacre was ruled as genocide by two international courts although Serbia has persistently rejected the definition.
In an address to the UN Security Council last week, Brammertz also slammed Serbia for continuing "to ignore and breach its legal obligations to cooperate with the Tribunal," by refusing to extradite three of its nationals for trial on witness intimidation charges.
Turkey detains nearly 200 pro-Kurdish party officials: media Ankara, Dec 12, 2016 (AFP) - Turkish police detained nearly 200 pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) officials on Monday over alleged links to Kurdish militants after deadly twin weekend blasts claimed by a radical Kurdish group.
The raids saw 198 HDP officials rounded up on suspicion of belonging to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) or producing propaganda for the group, state news agency Anadolu said.
Part of an anti-terror probe, the sweeping arrest operation came after weekend attacks killed 44 people in Istanbul, mostly police, which were claimed by the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK), seen as a radical offshoot of the PKK.
The other detentions took place in the southern provinces of Adana and Mersin, Manisa in western Turkey as well as Hakkari, Sanliurfa and Gaziantep in the country's restive southeast.
They are also accused of PKK membership or of promoting the group and are being held in pre-trial detention.
“It is pretty easy for me to say – many of the activities we are subject to have a clear sender, they can be traced more or less directly.
It can be about spreading false information, bending the truth, and emphasizing some arguments more than others to make it difficult to get a clearer picture of what is happening, ” Karlson said.
Cyberattacks which among other things attempt to gain access to intelligence are ongoing and have long taken place, he claimed.
“It is a serious threat because in different ways they can push themselves in to the very foundations of a democracy and and influence democratic decision-making, ” Karlson noted.
“That was easy to expose but clearly targeted against Sweden.
It’s often not the individual influence operations that do the worst damage, but it risks leading to a general mistrust of information”.

Exclusive: Dutch to demand limits on Ukraine at EU summit BRUSSELS Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte will ask European Union leaders on Thursday to rule out financial or security guarantees for Ukraine and not to offer Ukrainians the right to live and work in the bloc, according to a document seen by Reuters.
"The stakes are high," one diplomat said. "At the end of the day, if the association agreement is not ratified by the Dutch, it will be a defeat for Ukraine, a defeat for the EU and a victory for Russia ."
Another diplomat said: "It's expensive but worth it.
For that reason, diplomats expect an agreement, even if some governments - especially Ukraine's close allies in eastern Europe - are concerned and irritated by the Dutch demands.
A draft document prepared by the Dutch for EU leaders to endorse says the Ukraine association agreement "does not contain an obligation for the Union or its member states to provide collective security guarantees or other military aid or assistance to Ukraine ."
It says Ukrainian nationals are not granted "the right to reside and work freely" in the EU. It adds the agreement "does not require additional financial support" by the EU to Ukraine.
The Netherlands is the only EU state not to have ratified the accord.
Cuba had been the only Latin American country that did not have a so-called "dialogue and cooperation" deal with the EU covering issues such as trade, human rights and migration.

They go through schools and they sort of end up at the top of the pyramid ."
"They passed the test of life.... And I like the three that I have very, very much ."
Trump has chosen three retired generals for top jobs in his administration: James Mattis for secretary of defence, John Kelly for secretary of homeland security and Michael Flynn to be national security adviser.
"He's much more than a business executive," Trump said of Tillerson.

Kucinskis to evaluate every minister's performance at the beginning of 2017 RIGA, Dec 13 (LETA) - Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis (Greens/Farmers) will at the beginning of next year evaluate each minister's performance, as Kucinskis says in an interview with the Neatkariga Rita Avize newspaper.
When asked specifically about the Education and Science Minister Karlis Sadurskis (Unity), Kucinskis says that sometimes he can not understand Sadurskis' communication style, and that is something he has made clear to the minister.
"As for the government, there will be a lot of work to do, including changes to the tax system," says Kucinskis.
"Undeniably, we in the government will have to explain not only why taxes will be like this or that, we will also have to explain how these taxes will be used, especially in education and healthcare ."
Kucinskis says in the interview that some industries, for example, construction, are in downturn this year due to lack of co-financing by the European Union funds, but several programs will open under the EU funds next year that will make significant amounts of money available to local governments, at least forty schools and the major hospitals in Latvia.
Local governments will have many opportunities for the development of industrial areas to foster manufacturing and development.
And I believe that this will produce a good effect," says Kucinskis.
Kucinskis does not rule out, however, that soon there may be not enough local construction workers in the industry, but this problem will be easier to solve than unemployment and poverty.

UK finance minister hints at transitional Brexit deal London, Dec 13, 2016 (AFP) - Britain's Finance Minister Philip Hammond said Monday that a transitional arrangement could be "helpful" to smooth the country's exit from the European Union.
It "would tend towards a smoother transition and would run less risks of disruption including, crucially, risks to financial stability which must be a fairly real concern", he told parliament's Treasury committee.
This view was held by businesses, regulators, "thoughtful politicians" and civil servants on both sides of the English Channel, he said.
- Government split on approach to Brexit - Hammond campaigned for Britain to stay in the EU and, while backing the government's promise to implement the June referendum vote to leave, is widely viewed as pressing for a "soft" Brexit.
Hammond's comments came ahead of a House of Lords report released on Tuesday, which said Britain needs to draw up transitional arrangements to carry on trading with the EU after Brexit while they negotiate a long-term trade deal.
"But it would safeguard current trade and provide adequate time for negotiations," the joint report by the House of Lords' EU Internal Market and External Affairs Sub-committees said.
US presidential electors seek briefing on Russian hacking Washington, Dec 12, 2016 (AFP) - A group of electors who will ratify the US presidential election results next week on Monday called for a full briefing on accusations that Russia intervened to help Donald Trump win the vote.
"The electors require to know from the intelligence community whether there are ongoing investigations into ties between Donald Trump, his campaign or associates, and Russian government interference in the election, the scope of those investigations, how far those investigations may have reached, and who was involved in those investigations," they said in an open letter to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.
"We further require a briefing on all investigative findings, as these matters directly impact the core factors in our deliberations of whether Mr Trump is fit to serve as president of the United States ."
The US Constitution dictates that the electoral college ultimately decides the presidential election, not the popular vote.
In the November 8 vote, Clinton bested Trump in the popular vote by two percentage points, but Trump captured more states and earned 306 electors to Clinton's 232, giving him the White House victory.

NATO allies are well informed about disinformation risks before their arrival to Latvia - ambassador RIGA, Dec 13 (LETA) - NATO allies, including Canada, have been well information about possible disinformation risks before their arrival to Latvia, the Latvian Ambassador to Canada Karlis Eihenbaums told LETA.
Eihenbaums added that despite all of this, the coalition aimed at deterring aggression is growing, as Spain recently announced it will be joining the multinational battalion in Latvia together with Canada, Poland, Italy, Slovenia and Albania, and that it too wishes to contribute to the region's security.
Describing the disinformation campaign, the ambassador said that some might look at this and see it as silly and something which might not be taken seriously.
Our Canadian allies understand this very well, and are preparing for this," Eihenbaums said, adding that"the truth is always stronger than lies".
The Canadian Armed Forces are actively consulting Latvia and other NATO Allies on all aspects of Canada's upcoming deployment, "including ensuring that we are prepared to respond to disinformation and other potential challenges, if and when they occur," the embassy confirmed.
"Together, we are looking forward to working alongside our other NATO Allies to demonstrate our unity, solidarity, and resolve ."
LETA also reported, after the presidential elections in the United States and the European Parliament's resolution on the European Union's strategic communication to counteract propaganda against it by third parties, Russia has substantially increased its misinformation attacks against the Baltics.
The attitude of NATO and the EU in regards to the propaganda problem has finally made a radical u-turn, and member states are actively looking for solution to counter this problem, even though for some countries this "awakening" has been quite painful, Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics told LETA previously.
"If we compare to the mood which NATO and the EU had two years ago, when only the Baltics and Poland were speaking about the propaganda problem and the information war being directed towards us, and we were then rebuked about violating press freedoms and such, then now the mood has radically changed," the minister said.
"Now, the whole of NATO and the EU is speaking about the fact that we are facing two huge challenges - one is propaganda and the information war being directed towards Europe, and the other is cyber-attacks.
Countries which have had recent elections or other important political processes have finally identified these matters as serious problems," said Rinkevics.
Unity to vote against scrapping minimum social contributions and increasing microenterprise tax rate at Saeima committees today RIGA, Dec 13 (LETA) - Following a joint meeting of Unity's board and Saeima group this morning, the party has not changed its critical opinion about the proposal to temporarily scrap minimum social insurance contributions and increase the microenterprise tax rate to 15 percent from January 1.
Unity still believes that introducing minimum social contributions is the right decision, however, the minimum contributions may be postponed until a later time.
In the meantime, businessmen should have the option of choosing between paying a 15 percent microenterprise tax and the current tax rate plus minimum social contributions.
Unity's position is supported by most party members, emphasized Piebalgs. The party is ready to continue talks, and it is by no means intending to "rock the government's boat".
Today, the proposed changes to the microenterprise tax regime are to be discussed by Saeima Budget and Finance Committee and the matter of social contributions by the Social and Employment Matters Committee.
European Parliament tightens UKIP purse strings Strasbourg, France, Dec 13, 2016 (AFP) - The European Parliament on Monday decided to impose stricter conditions on financing for the European wing of Britain's anti-EU UKIP party, which has previously been penalised for misspending EU funds.
The Alliance for Direct Democracy in Europe (ADDE), a European political grouping dominated by nationalist UKIP, is among six organisations -- four political parties and two foundations linked to them -- which will only be entitled to a 33 percent advance in 2017, compared to the usual 80 percent, parliament said in a statement.
The ADDE had earlier come under scrutiny for soliciting European funds to finance "non-eligible expenses" linked in particular to campaigning in Britain by Nigel Farage's party, including for surveys ahead of the 2015 general elections and the referendum in June this year in which the country voted to leave the EU.

Turkey detains 2 more pro-Kurdish party MPs Ankara, Dec 13, 2016 (AFP) - Turkish police detained two more pro-Kurdish lawmakers hours after arresting over 200 people accused of links to Kurdish militants, their party said early Tuesday.
The two women, Caglar Demirel and Besime Konca, who represent the largest Kurdish-majority city of Diyarbakir and Siirt in the southeast respectively, were detained as part of a sweeping anti-terror probe, state news agency Anadolu said.
"Head of the party's parliamentary group Caglar Demirel and Siirt MP Besime Konca were unlawfully detained in front of our (Ankara) headquarters," the leftwing pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) said on Twitter.
However, neither the party nor Anadolu provided further detail on what the MPs are accused of.
Last month, 10 of the party's MPs -- including co-leaders Selahattin Demirtas and Figen Yuksekdag -- were arrested, sparking international condemnation.
In a report, 20 experts on the Middle East and jihadism also described how organizations such as Al-Qaeda and the group formerly known as the Al-Nusra Front are adapting methods and continuing to expand.

"Reconstruction, rehabilitation and particularly reconciliation are just as important as any military counterterrorism campaign in building societal resilience against the appeal of extremism.
The report highlights regional youth unemployment, with the rate of jobless youths in Gaza and the West Bank now 43 percent, 35 percent in Iraq, and 42 percent in Egypt.
President-elect Donald Trump has claimed he would "bomb the shit" out of the IS group, though he offered few details.

The larger the intervention, especially by the West, the greater the reaction," it states.
